SYNDROME </b><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><br>
<br>
They were promised a miracle cure for the deadly diseases destroying their
lives. It seemed too good to be true, but to the desperate and dying it was the
only chance for survival. Now they’re part of a bizarre secret experiment that
reverses the aging process – an experiment gone out of control. To stop the
madness, one woman must enter a shocking nightmare world, where scientists
control your body – and your mind – and living makes you beg for death . . .<br>
<br>
In her mid&#8209;thirties, Alexa Hampton runs her own interior design firm in </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt'>New York</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>’s </span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt'>Soho</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt'> and has a
daily run to keep fit. But now her world is narrowing as a childhood heart
mishap increasingly threatens to lethally impact her life. Then out of nowhere
her black&#8209;sheep younger brother appears and insists she go to a clinic in
</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>New Jersey</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt'> to enter stem&#8209;cell clinical trials that are working wonders. The
clinic is owned by her brother’s boss, the eccentric millionaire Winston
Bartlett.<br>
<br>
Also interested in the clinic is the medical reporter Stone Aimes, who’s hoping
to penetrate </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>’s veil of secrecy and find out what’s going on there.
He has personal as well as professional reasons for wanting to get closer to
Winston Bartlett. He is also a long&#8209;ago lover of Alexa’s and still
carrying something of a torch for her though they have long been out of touch.<br>
<br>
As Alexa investigates the clinic, their paths cross and together they slowly
uncover the horrifying truth about what can happen when stem&#8209;cell
technology is taken to its ultimate limit. A bizarre secret experiment to
reverse the aging process has gone out of control. Winston Bartlett’s young
mistress, the TV personality Kristen Starr, had an anti&#8209;aging procedure
that went awry and now all her cells are being replaced with new. The side
effects are horrific. No one can stop what is happening: she is growing
younger, destined to become a child again. </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'> has had the same procedure and now he knows he’s
next. It’s only a matter of time till he too regresses to childhood, and then .
. . no one knows.<br>
<br>
Alexa and Stone become prisoners in the clinic and then Bartlett and his Dutch
medical researcher Karl van der Vliet begin a bizarre experiment on Alexa,
hoping to produce antibodies to save Kristen, and Bartlett. In a stunning,
blazing finale, Alexa turns the tables on them all, only to discover that she’s
now, suddenly unlike anyone else who has ever lived.</span></p>

April 5 </span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Alexa Hampton was awakened by a sensation in her chest. The
alarm wasn't set to go off for another eleven minutes, but she knew her sleep
was finished.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Not again! She rolled over and slapped the blue pillowcase.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That little sound from her heart and the twinges of angina,
that catchall for heart discomfort, was happening more and more now, just as
Dr. Ekelman had warned her. But she wasn't going to let it stop her from living
her life to the fullest as long as she could, and right now that meant having
her morning run.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She curled her legs around, onto the floor, reached for a
nitroglycerin tab, and slipped it under her tongue. Known as a vasodilator, the
nitro lowered the workload on her heart by expanding her veins. It should get
her through the workout ....</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was when she felt a warm presence rub against her leg.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hi, baby.&quot; Still sucking on the tab, she reached
over and tousled Knickers' gray&#8209;and&#8209;white hair, then pushed it back
from her dog's eyes. Her Old English sheepdog, a huge hirsute off&#8209;road
vehicle, turned and licked her hand. Knickers was ready to hit the trail.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She'd been dreaming of Steve when the chest tightness came,
and maybe the emotion that stirred up had caused the angina. She still dreamed
of him often, and it was always someplace where they had been together and
loved, and they were ever on the brink of some disaster. That frequently caused
her heart to race, waking her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This time it was the vacation they took six years ago, in the
spring. They were sailing off </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Norman</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s Cay in the </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bahamas</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. She was raising the jib, the salt
spray in her hair, but then she looked up and realized they were about to ram a
reef.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She felt the dreams were her unconscious telling her to
beware her current precarious condition. If, as is said, at the moment of your
passing, your entire life flashes before your eyes, then the dreams were like
that, only in slow motion. It was as though she were being prepared for
something. The dreams were a premonition. She had a pretty good idea of what.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally had had rheumatic fever when she was five, which went
undetected long enough to scar a valve in her heart. The formal name was
rheumatoid aortic stenosis, a rare, almost freakish condition that had shaped
her entire life. The pediatrician at </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
 color:windowtext'>Mount Sinai</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
had told her parents they should think twice about allowing her to engage in
any vigorous activity. Her heart's function could be deceptively normal during
childhood but when she got older . . . Well, why stress that organ now and
hasten the inevitable day when it could no longer keep up with the rest of her
body?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She had refused to listen. She'd played volleyball in grade
school, basketball in high school, and she became a disciplined runner when she
went to </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Columbia</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> to study architecture. She wanted to
prove that you could make your heart stronger if you believed hard enough and
wanted to live hard enough.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now, though, it was all catching up. She'd had a complete
checkup two weeks ago Thursday, including a stress test and</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Doppler
echocardiogram, and Dr. Ekelman had laid out the situation, gazing over her
half&#8209;lens glasses and pulling at her chin. The normal twinkle in her eyes
was entirely absent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Alexa, your condition has begun worsening. There's a
clear aortic murmur now when your pulse goes up. How long can you go on living
in denial? You really can't keep on stressing your heart the way you have been.
You can have a normal life, but it's got to be low&#8209;key. Don't push your
luck.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Living half a life is so depressing,&quot; she'd
declared, not entirely sure she meant it. &quot;It's almost worse than none at
all.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ally, I'm warning you. If you start having chest
sensations that don't respond to nitro, call me immediately. I mean that.
There's a new drug, Ranolazine, that temporarily shifts your heart over to
using glucose as a fuel instead of fatty acids and provides more energy for a
given amount of oxygen. It will make the pain back off, but I only want to
start you on that as a last resort. That's the final stop before open&#8209;heart
surgery and a prosthetic aortic valve.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Day by day, the illusion of normality was getting harder and
harder to maintain. She had been playing second violin in an amateur string
quartet called the West Village Oldies, but a month ago she'd had to drop out.
She didn't have the endurance to practice enough to keep up with the others.
Blast. It was having to give up things you love that really hurt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Still, she was determined to keep a positive attitude. There
was your heart, and then there was heart. You had to understand the difference.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She lay back to wait for the alarm and try to compose her
mind. This Sunday morning was actually the one day of the year she most
dreaded. The anniversary.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It had been back when Steve was still alive. They were living
in the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Chelsea</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> neighborhood of </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New York</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, in a brownstone town house they
were renting. The rent was high, but they were doing all right. Steve was a
political consultant, who had helped some fledgling candidates overcome the
odds and win important elections. In between campaigns here, he also got work
in the nominal democracies in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Latin
 America</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was a partner in a small firm of architects who had all
been at </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Columbia</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> together and decided to team up
after graduation and start a business. There were four of them—she was the only
woman—and it was a struggle at the beginning. For the first three years they
had to live off crumbs tossed their way by the big boys, subcontracts from
Skidmore and other giants. They felt like they were a high&#8209;paid version
of Manpower, Inc., doing grunt work, designing the interiors of shopping malls
in the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Midwest</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> and banks in </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Saudi Arabia</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, while their prime contractors got
to keep all the sexy, big&#8209;budget jobs that called for creativity, like a
glass&#8209;and&#8209;steel office tower in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>L.A.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But then interesting work finally started to trickle in, including
a plum job to convert a massive parking garage in </span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Greenwich Village</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> into a luxury condominium. Through a
wild coincidence (or luck) she had personally designed the apartment she later
ended up buying for herself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Just when everything seemed to be turning around and going
her way, an event happened that stopped her in her tracks. Five years ago on
this very day, April 5, her mother, Nina, phoned her at six&#8209;thirty in the
morning and, in a trembling voice that still haunted, announced that her father
was dead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arthur Wade Hampton was fifty&#8209;nine and he’d been
cleaning his Browning shotgun for an early&#8209;morning hunting trip to Long
Island—so he’d claimed the night before—and ... she was awakened by the
explosion of a discharge. A horrible accident in the kitchen of their co&#8209;op
in the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>West</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Village</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Like Hemingway. Thinking back, they both realized it was the
wrong time of year to hunt anything—but they both also knew he wanted the world
to think that. Moreover, it was precisely the kind of vital lie they'd need to
get through the pointed questions and skeptical looks that lay ahead. It was a
knowledge all the more palpable for being unspoken. There's no time like those
first moments after a tragedy to create a special reality for yourself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was only in the aftermath that she managed to unravel the
reason. He owned and operated an interior&#8209;design firm in </span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>SoHo</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> called CitiSpace, and he had mortgaged it to the
hilt. He was on the verge of bankruptcy. (That was why Ally had not spoken to
her younger brother, Grant, in the last 4 1/2 years.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She felt she had no choice but to try to salvage what was
left of the business and her father's reputation. She left the architectural
firm and took over CitiSpace. It turned out she was easily as good an interior
designer as she had been an architect, and before long she had a backlog of
work and was adding staff. She restructured and, eventually paid off the firm's
debt; it was now on a sound financial footing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>These days CitiSpace specialized in architectural rehabs in
the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Greenwich Village</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> area, with as many </span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>SoHo</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> and TriBeCa lofts as came her way. The work was
mostly residential, but lately some lucrative commercial office jobs were
beginning to walk through the door. Anything dependent on luxury real estate
can be vulnerable in dicey times, but she'd been able to give everybody a
holiday bonus for the past couple of years. She'd even given herself one this
year, in the form of this new condo apartment, which she loved.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Another major reason she'd taken over CitiSpace was to try to
provide her mother some peace and dignity in her twilight years. But then,
irony of ironies, Nina, who was a very lively sixty&#8209;six, was diagnosed
eighteen months ago with early&#8209;onset Alzheimer's. Now her consciousness
was rapidly slipping away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>All the things that had happened over the last few years had
called for a special kind of heart. She had known Steve Jensen, a freelance
political consultant, for eight years, and they'd lived together for three of
those, before they got married. He was warm and tender and sexy, and she'd
envisioned them in rocking chairs forty years down the road. They'd been
married for only six months when he got a job to help reelect the president of </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Belize</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. At first he was reluctant,
concerned about human rights issues, but then he decided the other candidate,
the alternative, was even worse. So he went.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>How many things can be destined to go wrong in your life?
Exactly seven months after her dad died, she received a phone call from the
American Embassy in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Belmopan</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Belize</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>. Steve had been flying with the presidential candidate over
a stretch of southern rain forest in a single&#8209;engine Cessna when a sudden
thunderstorm came out of the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Caribbean</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> and the plane lost radio contact.
That was the last, etc.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She rushed there, but after two weeks the &quot;rescue&quot;
officially became a &quot;recovery&quot; mission. Except there was never any
recovery. After two months she flew back alone, the loneliest plane ride of her
life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She still had his clothes in her closet, as though to keep
hope alive. When you love someone so much you think you could never live
without them—and then one day you're forced to—it resets your thinking. Her
dad's death and then Steve's . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She wanted to love life, but life sometimes felt like it was
asking more than she should have to give. She currently had no one special to
spend her weekends with, but she hadn't given up, nor was she pushing it. All
things in time, except time could be running out. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Brrrring went the alarm and Knickers responded with a lively
&quot;Woof&quot; She was anxious to get going.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Come on, baby,&quot; Ally said. &quot;Time for a
treat.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She struggled up and made her way into the kitchen and got
down a box of small rawhide chews. It would give Knickers something to occupy
her mind for the few minutes it took to get ready.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Since she lived at the west end of Barrow Street, right
across the highway from the new Hudson River Park esplanade that defined that
mighty river's New York bank, she had a perfect course for her morning runs.
She usually liked to run down to the park at the rejuvenated </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Battery</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Park</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
 </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>City</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> and then back. She didn't know what
the distance was exactly, maybe three&#8209;quarters of a mile each way, maybe
slightly more, but it fit her endurance nicely. The weather was still cool
enough in the mornings that Knickers could accompany her at full trot. In the
heat of summer, however, they both had to cut back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She'd put on blue sweats, got her Walkman prepped with a
Beethoven quintet, and was just finishing cinching her running shoes when the
phone jangled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Grant Hampton listened to the ringing and felt the sweat on
his palms. For a normal person, this would be an insane time to call, but
knowing his nutbag sister, she was probably already up and about to go out for
her daily run. And this on a Sunday morning, for chrissake, when rational
people were drinking coffee or having sex or doing something sensible like
retrieving the Times from the hallway and reading the columns in the Business
section. He had left Tanya, his runway model live&#8209;in, to get her beauty
sleep and had driven downtown at this unthinkable hour on a mission. He was
chief financial officer of Bartlett Medical Devices, Inc., which was in
imminent danger of going under and taking him with it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Come on, Ally. Pick up the frigging phone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He gazed out the windshield of his blue Porsche, now parked
directly across the street from Alexa's lobby, and tried to calm his pulse. He
hadn't entirely worked out the pitch, but that was okay because he wanted to
sound spontaneous. Who was it said, &quot;Sincerity, if you can just fake that,
you've got it made?&quot; That was what—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

right?&quot;       Come on, he thought, give me an opening here.  There was a
pause that Grant Hampton thought lasted an eternity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>      
&quot;You picked a funny time to call.&quot;  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>        Is
that all she has to say? Four and a half frigging years she shuts me out of her
life, blaming me, and then ...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>        
&quot;Well, Ally, I figured there's gotta be a statute of limitations on being
accused of something I didn't do. So I decided to take a flier that maybe four
years and change was in the ballpark.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>       
&quot;Grant, do you know what time it is? This is Sunday and—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>       
&quot;Hey, this is the hour you do your Sunday run, right? If memory serves. So
I thought I might drive down and keep you company.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>         He
didn't want to let her know that he was already there. That would seem
presumptuous and probably tick her off even more. But by God he had to get to
her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>        
Again there was a long pause. Like she was trying to collect and marshal her
anger.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>       
&quot;You want to come to see me? Now? That's a heck of a—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>        
&quot;Look, there's something really important I need to talk to you about.
It's actually a big favor for you, sis. You've surely heard of Winston
Bartlett?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>        
&quot;I've also heard of Donald Trump. So?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>        
&quot;Well, he's got a clinic out in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>New Jersey</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
that—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>        
&quot;Grant, I know you're a big shot in his medical conglomerate or whatever
it is, but I'm not interested in whatever you're peddling. I'm going out to run
now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>          He
heard the sound of the phone clicking off, without so much as a good&#8209;bye.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>        
Jesus, he thought, she really is ticked. This is going to be harder than I thought.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>       
Okay, here goes Plan B.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>        He
started the Porsche and slowly backed to the corner of </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Washington Street</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, where he parked again and then
hunkered down, loving the smell of the new leather seat. Ally was going to come
charging out of the front door in about two minutes, with that damned sheepdog
that Steve gave her, assuming it was still around.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Grant Hampton was three years younger than Alexa and he lived
in a different world. Whereas she'd never wanted to be anything but an
architect, he had aimed directly for NYU School of Business. After that, he had
gone to Wall Street and gotten a broker's license and begun an extremely
lucrative career as a bond trader for Goldman Sachs. He discovered he had the
nerves, as well as a gift for handling big numbers in his head. Soon he had a
duplex co&#8209;op on the twenty&#8209;sixth floor of a new building on </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Third Avenue</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> in the East Sixties. He loved the
money and the pad He also liked how easy it was to pick up models at downtown
clubs if you had your own co&#8209;op, a Porsche, and were six feet tall with a
designer wardrobe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was where he met Tanya, also six feet tall, a striking
(natural) redhead who did a lot of runway work for Chloe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He thought he was making a lot of money, but Tanya, who could
order a two&#8209;hundred&#8209;dollar bottle of Dom Perignon to have something
to pass the time while the hors d'oeuvres were being whipped up at Nobu, taught
him he was just barely getting by. She was accustomed to screwing men who had
some depth to their money.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But when he tried a financial endeavor on the side, it turned
into a disaster. Time to move on. He sent around his resume and managed to get
an interview with BMD, which was looking for someone to help them hedge their
exposure in foreign currencies. The next thing he knew, he was trading bonds
for Winston Bartlett's personal account.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s CFO died of a heart attack at age
forty&#8209;nine (while undergoing oral sex in the backseat of a chauffeured
Lincoln Town Car), Grant Hampton got temporarily drafted to take over his
responsibilities. That was two years ago. He was aggressive enough that there
was never a search for a replacement. He had made the big time, and he had done
it before he was thirty&#8209;five.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But now it all hung in the balance. If this didn't work out,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>he could end
up cold&#8209;calling widows out of Dun &amp; Bradstreet, hawking third&#8209;rate
IPOs. Tanya would be gone in a heartbeat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally, work with me for chrissake.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

 style='text-transform:uppercase'> a.m.</span></span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Alexa stepped out of the lobby, the morning was glorious
and clear. Spring had arrived in a burst of pear and cherry blossoms in the </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>garden</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> of </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>St. Luke</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>'s Church, up the street, but here by the river the morning
air was still brisk enough to make her skin tingle. The sun was lightening the
east, setting a golden halo above the skyscrapers of mid&#8209;town. Here, with
the wind tasting lightly of salt, the roadways were Sunday&#8209;morning silent
and it was a magic time that always made her feel the world was young and
perfect and she was capable of anything.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This was her private thinking time—even dreaming time—and she
shared it only with Knickers, who was trotting along beside her now, full of
enthusiasm. Ally suspected that her sheepdog enjoyed their morning runs along
the river even more than she did.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As she headed south, toward Battery Park City, she pondered
the weird phone call she'd just gotten from Grant Seth Hampton. That was his
full name. She called him Grant, but her mother, Nina, always called him Seth.
Unfortunately, by whatever name, Grant Seth Hampton, an unremitting hustler,
was still her brother. She wished it were not so, but some things couldn't be
changed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In truth, she actually thought Grant had exhibited a kind of
sequential personality over his life. When they were kids, he'd seemed rakish
but also decent. At the time, of course, she was impulsive and rebellious
herself, admiring of his spunk. Now she viewed that as his Early Personality.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Later, when he was pushing thirty and the Wall Street
pressure and the coke moved in, he evolved into Personality</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Number Two.
He lost touch with reality and in the process he also lost his inner moral
compass. His character bent and then broke under the stress, proving, she now
supposed, that he was actually a weak reed after all. Now she didn't know what
his personality was.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Grant, Grant, she often lamented, how did everything manage
to turn out so bad with you?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He'd been a bond trader for Goldman, and at family gatherings
he'd brag about making three hundred thou a year. But he had a high&#8209;maintenance
lifestyle involving downtown models he was constantly trying to impress with
jewelry and expensive vacations, so that wasn't enough. He decided to freelance
on the side. He set up a Web site and, with his broker's license, opened a
retail business trading naked futures contracts on Treasuries. He managed to
get some naive clients and for a while made a profit for them. But then the
market turned against him, or maybe he lost his rabbit's foot, and he began
losing a lot of other people's money.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A couple of his clients with heavy losses felt that he'd
misrepresented the risk, and they were getting ready to sue. They also were
threatening to file a complaint with the SEC. There was a real possibility he
could be barred from the financial industry for life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The only thing that would put the matter to rest was if he
made good some of their losses. But Grant, who lived hand to mouth no matter
what his income, didn't have any liquidity. A reserve? That's for guys who
don't have any balls.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She pieced this story together after the fact. Somehow he'd
gotten to their father, who bailed him out mainly to save the family from
disgrace. In doing so, he had mortgaged CitiSpace right up to the breaking
point.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When she finally unraveled this poignant tale, she realized
her father believed he was going to have to declare bankruptcy and close the
firm, laying everybody off and leaving Nina a pauper. He thought the only way
to save the family from ruin was to collect on his life insurance.
Unfortunately, however, he botched the plan. Nobody believed his death was accidental
and suicide voided the 3&#8209;million&#8209;dollar policy....</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Grant had always inhabited another planet from her dad but
surely these days he was able to support any lifestyle he chose. For the last
two years he'd been some kind of hotshot financial manager for the high&#8209;stakes
conglomerate owned by Winston Bartlett, or so Nina said. He should be making
big bucks. Had he managed to screw that up somehow? Anytime he came crawling
back to the family for anything, it was because he was in some kind of trouble.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She hadn't seen him in so long she wondered if she'd even
recognize him—not that she had any plans to see him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But what could Grant possibly want from her now? Also, why
would he pick this morning, this anniversary morning, to reappear? Didn't he
know what day this was? Or maybe he didn't actually care.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He'd been living on the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
 color:windowtext'>East Side</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
that fateful morning of their dad Is death, in a doorman co&#8209;op he surely
couldn't afford, and she'd taken a cab there to tell him in person rather than
do it over the phone. When she did, her voice breaking, she could see his eyes
already filtering out any part of it that touched him. By today he'd probably
purged it out of his memory entirely....</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She had reached the vast lawn that had been built on the
landfill behind Stuyvesant High, the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
 color:windowtext'>Hudson River</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
on one side and the huge expanse of green on the other. It was manicured and
verdant, a La Grande Jatte expanse of grass where you could see visions of
wicker picnic baskets and bottles of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
 color:windowtext'>Beaujolais</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.
The space was deserted now and smelled of new grass. Knickers had gotten ten
paces ahead of her, as though impatient that Alexa was slowing her down, but
then she paused in midstride to sniff at a bagel somebody had tossed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Come on, honey.&quot; Ally caught up with her,
wheezing. &quot;Time to backtrack. My chest is getting tight again. Goodies at
home.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Knickers glared at her dolefully for a moment, not buying the
argument.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let's go.&quot; She resumed her stride back north,
knowing—well, hoping—Knickers would follow. &quot;Home.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Her senses must have been slowing down too, because she
honestly didn't hear him when he came up behind her three minutes later....</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>Sunday, April 5 </h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>8:29<span
 style='text-transform:uppercase'> a.m.</span></span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Didn't think I could keep up, did you?&quot; Grant
Hampton quipped from ten paces back. &quot;Guess you didn't know I've started
playing handball every other morning. Half an hour, with the </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Man.</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> Great for the stamina. Not to mention brown&#8209;
nosing the boss, since naturally I let him win.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She doesn't look half bad, he thought. Maybe she's getting
out ahead of that heart problem. Maybe she's actually okay and I'm screwed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Fuck.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But why is she still so fried at me? Sure, I had a little
trouble, but everybody has ups and downs. Nina, that hardhearted bitch, wants
to blame me for Arthur's death, when it was nobody's fault but his own that the
old fart pulled the plug. Hell, I was going to pay back the money. He just
didn't believe in me. He never did.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What are you doing here, Grant?&quot; When she turned
to look back at him, she realized she wasn't prepared for this moment at all,
but here he was, complete with a trendy CK running outfit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She'd only seen him a couple of times after the funeral, and
he looked like life was treating him well. The perfect tan, the lush sandy hair
with an expensive cut that covered the top of his ears like a precise little
helmet. He was a touch over six feet, with athletic shoulders, a trim figure,
and a graceful fluidity to his stride. No wonder he scores with models. Damn.
How could such a creep look that great?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I told you, I'm trying to do you a favor.&quot; He momentarily
pulled ahead, as though to head her off, then looked back and grinned. She
thought she detected a vaguely demented quality in his gray eyes. &quot;Hey,
I've turned my life around, Ally. Lots of good karma. I'm CFO for BMD, and W.B.
lets me handle a lot of his personal investing too.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She put on a burst of energy, trying unsuccessfully to get
out ahead of him. Even though she'd rehearsed this inevitable moment over and
over in her mind, she hadn't realized that seeing him again would be this
upsetting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Why was he here? But now that he was, maybe she ought to
momentarily let go of the anger long enough to find out what he wanted.
Fortunately, they were almost back to </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Barrow Street</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>. So this was going to be quick; no way was she going to ask
him up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Look,&quot; Grant declared over his shoulder, &quot;I
think it's high time to admit I've been a shit. To you and to a lot of
people.&quot; Now he slowed enough that she pulled alongside. &quot;For a long
time there, back when I worked for Goldman, I was an immature asshole. But at
least I'm mature enough now to admit it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think the window for owning up is past.&quot; She
didn't need his belated mea culpa. Nothing was going to bring their father
back, and having a scene on this anniversary day would only demean his memory.
&quot;Sometimes it's better just to let things rest.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, that's wrong, Ally, and I want to try and start
making amends. For all the money Dad helped me out with. I want to do a
kindness for you, to repay you and Mom as best I can.&quot; Now he was jogging
along beside her as smooth as a stroll, barely breathing. It was adding to her
humiliation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Grant, it's a little fucking late for that. Dad’s gone.
Money's not going to bring him back. And I'm okay, Mom's okay—at least for
money.&quot; Well, she thought, that's true for now, but who knows what lies
ahead? &quot;So what's a couple of million or so between siblings, anyway?
Right? It's the price of finding out who everybody is.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Just now, she told herself, the biggest &quot;kindness &quot;
he could do would be to disappear. Forever. She'd thought she was over the bulk
of the pain and the feelings of humiliation, but seeing him again, hearing his
voice, and looking at his eyes was bringing all of it back. She realized she
was never going to be over it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ally, go ahead and say whatever you need to ... Look, I
can't really do anything about the money, at least not right this minute—though
I've got a big ship on the horizon, assuming a deal I'm working on comes
through. But right now I'm about to try to do you a favor.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think I can muddle through without any of your
'favors,' Grant. And I really don't appreciate your showing up out of the blue
like this, bullying your way back into my life.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She glanced over and saw his gray eyes were hangdog. It was
the soulful look he used to melt her resolve. But not this time. She was
yelling at herself inside not to give an inch. If she let him anywhere close to
her life again, she was sure she'd only regret it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, like it or not, I am here at the moment,&quot; he
said, once more jogging a pace ahead then twisting his head back. They were at
the crossing and he could see her building from where they were. He had to get
a hook into her before she disappeared into that damned lobby. Time for the
bait. &quot;By the way, Ally, how's your ticker doing these days? You still have
to watch out for... that heart thing?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Look, Grant, I've got a busy morning. I'm going up to
see Mom, not that you'd give a damn. So thank you for inquiring about my
health, but frankly what do you care?&quot; She paused. &quot;Tell you what. If
your 'favor' is so wonderful, I'll give you one phone call. Tonight, at
home.&quot; She had Knickers' leash on a short hold and was waiting for the
light to change. &quot;But I've got to go now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Shit, he thought, the hook didn't catch. &quot;Can't be on
the phone, I'm telling you. I needed to see you. Why the hell do you think I
took the trouble to catch you before your day got started? You know I hate
getting up this early.&quot; He stepped onto the curb and stopped. &quot;Ally,
please listen. This is something I can do for you. I won't insult you by saying
it's for old times' sake, but in a way it is. I got you a shot at a big job. </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span

you to come by and meet him and help him kick around some ideas.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She looked at him, not believing a word.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You hacked into my life at </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>seven o'clock</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

What do you really want? And this better be good.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Okay, he thought. Cut to the chase.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're correct. It's about your heart.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What about it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Make it real, he told himself. This could be your only shot.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All right, here's the unvarnished deal. What I really
did for you. About five years ago, </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
bankrolled a start&#8209;up bio&#8209;med firm called the Gerex Corporation. It
was the brainchild of a Dutch doctor whose research project had just been sawed
off at the knees by </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Stanford</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>University</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.
Then </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> moved the entire operation to a
clinic at the BMD campus out in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>New Jersey</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
called the Dorian Institute. It's all very hush&#8209;hush, but I can tell you
Gerex has a new procedure in clinical trials that can literally work miracles.
The head researcher, this Dutch doctor, has pioneered a new treatment using a
stem cell procedure to trick an organ into regenerating itself, even a heart.
It's like you grow your own transplant.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now she was finally listening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I was talking to the Dutch guy late last week,&quot; he
went on, picking up a faint positive vibe and hoping desperately he could build
on it, &quot;and he said he's looking for someone in their thirties with a
rheumatic&#8209;heart thing—I think it's like what you have—to be part of this
big clinical trial they're wrapping up. But they have to do it immediately, so
they can put the data in their final report to the National Institutes of
Health.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And you thought about me? That's very touching, Grant.
Your idea of doing me a favor is to let some Dutch quack experiment on
me?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, don't be so fast to turn up your nose at
this.&quot; Shit, he thought, how am I going to make any headway? &quot;His
procedure operates at the cell level. The way they say it works is he takes
cells from your bone marrow or blood or . . . whatever and makes them
'immortal' with this special enzyme and then injects them into organ tissue. It
causes that organ to start regenerating itself.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That sounds completely like science fiction. Besides,
I'm not—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, he's doing it. Trust me. But there're only a
couple of weeks left in the clinical trials, so everything's on a fast track
now. If you're the least bit interested, you've got to call him tomorrow. If
you don't, I'm sure he'll find somebody else by the middle of the week.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He reached down and tried to give Knickers a pat, but she
drew away. Good for her, Ally thought. Then he looked up and his voice grew
animated. &quot;Ally, the Dutch doctor—his name is Van de Vliet, by the way—is
the smartest man I've ever met. I'd say he's a good bet for the Nobel Prize in
Medicine this time next year. I'd put my last dime on it. What he's doing is so
incredible I shouldn't even be talking about it. At least not till the clinical
trials are finished. But I wanted to do you this favor.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Uh&#8209;huh, she thought. What it amounted to was, he was
coming to her with another one of his hustles. Probably they needed somebody to
round out their clinical trials and she was conveniently handy. &quot;You know,
Grant, maybe I'll just pass. I already have a cardiologist.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She found herself wondering what Dr. Ekelman would say to
this radical new treatment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All right, Ally, do you want to make me beg? I need you</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>to do this.
When I described you to Dr. Van de Vliet, I could tell he was very excited.
This could change everything for you.&quot; He paused, perhaps becoming aware
of the pleading tone in his voice. &quot;For chrissake, give me a break. Is
there someplace we can have coffee? I'm not asking to come upstairs or
anything. I just want to see if we can be on speaking terms long enough to help
each other out.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In a way she was relieved though she was secretly hurt all
over again too. He wasn't crawling back to her to beg forgiveness for
destroying lives. No, he was back and groveling because he thought she could
help him butter up his boss. How could she not feel used?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>God, that was so like him. At that moment she knew there was
never any chance he'd change.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Come on,&quot; he said again. &quot;A lousy cup of
coffee. There's that little French bistro on </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Hudson Street</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>.&quot; He tried a grin. &quot;Hey, I'll even buy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>For a moment she thought she felt her resolve slipping. It's
funny, but after you break up a family, no matter how dysfunctional, you start
repressing the bad memories. But then something comes along to remind you all
over again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Grant, are you hearing yourself?&quot; She stared at
him. &quot;You sound like you're selling snake oil.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why was I afraid you'd back off? You're really doing it
because you're pissed. Okay, you've got a right. But I've brought you something
I think you ought to at least look at.&quot; He was unzipping his fanny pack
and taking out a Gerex Corporation envelope, folded in half.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Christ, he thought miserably, why is she doing this to me?
I've got to keep the door open.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Read this and then give me a call tonight, like you
promised. It'll tell you more about him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She hesitated before taking it. It was thick with papers and
she was planning to spend the day visiting Nina. &quot;I think I've heard
enough already.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just look at his CV. Van de Vliet's. He's done a lot of</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>things.
You've got to take him seriously.&quot; He urged it into her hand. &quot;Look
at it and call me. Please.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She took it, and then she reached down and patted Knickers.
&quot;Come on, baby. Let's go up.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He watched her disappear into the lobby and start shooting
the breeze with the doorman, some red&#8209;haired jerk with a ponytail who'd
just come on duty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Damn. Maybe the best thing would be just to chloroform her
and let her wake up in the lab. W.B. needs her.</span></p>

<h1><a name=bookmark4><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Chapter 2</span></a></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Sunday, April 5 </h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>8:20 A.M.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, you'd better take it from here,&quot; Winston
Bartlett declared to Kenji Noda over the roar of the engine. He had lifted his
feet off the pedals and was unbuckling the cockpit seat belt. He liked having a
turn piloting his McDonnell Douglas 520N helicopter on the commutes between his
corporate headquarters in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Lower
 Manhattan</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> and his
medical research park in northern </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>New Jersey</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>,
but prudence dictated a more experienced hand on the collective during descent
and landing. For that he had Noda, formerly of the Japanese Defense Forces. A
tall, wiry man of few words, Noda was also his bodyguard, chauffeur, and curator
of his museum&#8209;quality <i>katana </i>sword collection.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>With the sharp, delicious aroma of the pine forest below
wafting through the cabin, Noda quickly put aside the origami he'd been
folding, to center his mind and slid around a special opening in the bulkhead.
He strapped himself into the seat, then took the radio headphones. The sky was
the purest blue, with not another craft in the visual perimeter. They were,
after all, over a forest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> settled himself in the passenger
compartment, he thought about where matters stood. There was the very real
prospect he had rolled the dice one time too many. The daily blood tests at his
clinic in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New Jersey</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> were showing he was disturbingly
close to using up his nine lives.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>To look at him, though, you'd never suspect. At sixty&#8209;seven
he was still trim and athletic, confident even cocky, with a full head of steel
dark hair and probing eyes that instantly appraised whatever they caught in
their gaze. He played handball at a private health club near his </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Gramercy</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Park</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
mansion for an hour every other morning and he routinely defeated men half his
age, including Grant Hampton. Remaining a player in every sense of the term was
the main reason he enjoyed flying his M&#8209;D chopper, even though his
license had been lapsed for eight years. It was the perfect embodiment of his
lust for life. As he never failed to point out, his lifelong business success
wasn't bad for a </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>City</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>College</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
grad with a bachelor's degree in Oriental art history. He had gotten this far
because he wanted success enough to make it happen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He'd started out in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>New York</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
real estate, but for the last twenty years he had concentrated on buying up
small, under&#8209; priced medical&#8209;device manufacturers with valuable
patents and weak bottom lines. He dismantled some of the companies and sold off
the pieces, always for more than he'd paid for the whole. Others he
restructured with new management, and when a profitable turnaround was in
sight, he took them public or sold them to a major player like Johnson &amp;
Johnson. The potential winners, though, the ones with promising pipelines of
medical devices or drugs whose FDA approval was imminent, he relocated here at
the BMD campus in northern </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New
  Jersey</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But competition was fierce, and the bigger players like Merck
and J&amp;J had limitless research capital. They could write off dead ends a
lot easier. Thus it was that five years ago, when his pipeline was drying up,
Winston Bartlett took the biggest gamble of his life. He acquired a cash&#8209;strapped
new start&#8209;up called the Gerex Corporation, whose head scientist was at
the cutting edge of stem cell research. Karl Van de Vliet, M.D., Ph.D., had
just had his funding terminated and his laboratory at </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Stanford</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>University</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
closed after a political flap by right&#8209;wingers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
had moved Van de Vliet here to </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New
  Jersey</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> and poured
millions into his stem cell efforts, bleeding BMD's working capital white and
racking up 85 million in short&#8209;term debt just to keep the rest of the
company afloat. Now, though, the gamble was paying off. This month Gerex was
winding up stage&#8209;three clinical trials for the National Institutes of
Health. These trials validated a revolutionary procedure that changed the rules
of everything known about healing the human body. Already his CFO, Grant
Hampton, was heading a negotiating team hammering out a deal with the British
biotech conglomerate Cambridge Pharmaceuticals to sell them a 49 percent stake
in Gerex. Over 650 million in cash and stock were on the table, and there were
escalators, depending on the results of the trials now under way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The problem was, </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Cambridge</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
had only seen the financial and summaries of data from Gerex's successful
clinical trials. They knew nothing about the fiasco of the Beta procedure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Karl called just before we left and said she's worse
this morning,&quot; </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> remarked to Noda. He was removing
his aviator shades and there was deep frustration in his eyes. &quot;God I feel
so damned responsible. She was—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Having the Beta was Kristen's idea,&quot; Noda reminded
him. &quot;She wanted to do it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What he didn't say was on both their minds: what about
Bartlett himself? After Kristen Starr had had the Beta, and it had seemed
successful, </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> decided to have it too. Now his
daily blood tests here at the institute were showing that the telomerase enzyme
was starting to metastasize and replicate in his bloodstream, just as it had in
hers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well,&quot; </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
went on, &quot;Karl thinks he's got a new idea that might save us. </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Hampton</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> is supposed to be on the case this
very morning.&quot; He stared out the chopper's window, down at the rooftops of
his empire. At the north end of the industrial park was the main laboratory,
where stents and titanium joint replacements were tested on animals—mostly
sterile pigs, though some primate testing also was under way. The central area
had two large manufacturing facilities where the more complex devices were
made.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The buildings were all white cinder block, except for the one
they were hovering above now. It was at the far south end, a massive three&#8209;story
mansion nestled among ancient pines and reached by a long cobblestone driveway.
Though it was actually the oldest building of the group by a hundred years, it
was the latest acquisition for the complex. It fronted a beautiful ten&#8209;acre
lake, and had been a summer <i>palacio</i> of a nineteenth&#8209;century railroad
baron. Around mid&#8209;century it was turned into a luxury retirement home,
complete with nursing services. Its ornate appointments reminded patients of
the Frick Gallery, if one could imagine those marble halls teeming with
wheelchairs and nurses.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Bartlett had bought the defunct manufacturing complex next to
it eighteen years earlier for the BMD industrial park, but it was only six
years ago that the owners of the mansion, a group of squabbling heirs, finally
relented and agreed to part with the property. It was now a flagship holding of
BMD.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He had an eye for design and he had loved remodeling the old
mansion and making it into a modern clinic and research facility. He had
renamed it the Dorian Institute and moved in Karl Van de Vliet and the research
staff of the Gerex Corporation. He also had put a landing pad on the expansive
roof, along with a stair leading down to an elevator that could take him

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Kenji Noda settled the McDonnell Douglas onto the pad and cut
the engines. </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> never let himself worry about the
noise. The patients in the clinical trials were here at no charge, so they
really couldn't complain, particularly since they were now part of what was
possibly turning out to be the greatest advance in the history of medicine. If
your Alzheimer's had just been reversed at no charge, you weren't going to
complain about a little hubbub on the roof.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll wait here,&quot; Noda said opening the side door.
His bald pate, reminiscent of an eighteenth&#8209;century samurai, glistened in
the early spring sun.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
nodded, knowing that his pilot did not trust physicians and hospitals. Taking
care of your body was your responsibility, Kenji Noda frequently declared and
he trained his own daily. He ate no meat and drank gallons of green tea. When
he practiced <i>kendo</i> swordplay, he had the reflexes of a man half his age.
He never discussed why he had left </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

but </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
headed down the metal stairs leading to the self&#8209; service elevator. This
daily ordeal of flying out to give a blood sample and to see Kristen was
increasingly unsettling. As he inserted his magnetic card into the elevator
security box, he felt his hand shaking slightly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So close to the eternal dream of humankind. So close. How was
it going to end?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Dr. Vee, I'm feeling so much better, I can't tell
you.&quot; Emma Rosen reached out and caught her physician by the collar of his
lab coat, pulling him down and brazenly bussing his cheek. She'd been longing
to do this for three weeks but hadn't mustered the nerve until now. &quot;This
morning I climbed the stairs to the third floor, twice, up and back without any
chest pain. Oy, can you believe? It's a miracle.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Karl Van de Vliet was a couple of inches over six feet, with
a trim face and sandy hair that some older patients judged too long for a
physician. His English normally was perfect, though sometimes he made a mistake
when trying to sound too colloquial. But everyone, young and old adored his
retiring Dutch manner and those deep blue eyes that carried some monumental
sadness from the past. They also were sure he would soon be recognized
worldwide as the miracle worker he was. The prospect of a Nobel didn't actually
seem that far&#8209;fetched.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Emma, please, I begged you to rest.&quot; He sighed and
checked the dancing electronic pens of her EKG. They were in the basement of
the Dorian Institute. Upstairs, the &quot;suites&quot;—nobody called them
rooms—were intended to invoke a spa more than a clinic, so most of the heavy&#8209;duty
diagnostic equipment was kept in a row of examining rooms down near the
subterranean lab. &quot;For another week at least. Why won't you listen? You've
been a very naughty girl. I may have to tell your daughter.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He glanced at the seventy&#8209;three&#8209;year&#8209;old
woman's readout one last time, made a quick note on his handheld computer, and
then laid a thin hand across her brow for a fleeting, subjective temperature
check.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She's all but fully recovered, he told himself. It's truly
astonishing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Five weeks earlier, she had come through the front door of
the Dorian Institute in a wheelchair pushed by her youngest, a bottle blonde
named Shelly. He took one look and scuttled the normal security precautions,
the frisk for cameras and recording devices. Emma's low cardiac output had
deteriorated to the point that her left leg below the knee was swollen to
almost twice its normal size, owing to renal retention of fluid, and she was so
short of breath she required oxygen. He hadn't wanted to complicate the clinical
trials by taking on another patient at that late date, but she had been
referred by a physician friend in the city, begging. How could he turn her
away?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He had removed a microscopic amount of bone marrow from her
right ankle, extracted the stem cells, applied the hormonal signal that told
them to develop into heart muscle, and then injected a thriving cell factory
into her heart. Since stem cells could be made to ignore the body's rules to
stop replicating after a certain number, they were able to reproduce forever,
constantly renewing themselves. The only other cells with that immortal
characteristic were cancer cells. In fact, it was as though he had given Emma a
new kind of cancer—one that produced cells as healthy as those in a newborn.
Today she probably could have run up those stairs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Although his stem cell technology was going to create a new
era in regenerative medicine, he had experienced his share of bumps in the
road. Five years earlier, </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Stanford</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>University</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
had canceled his research project there since the work he had been doing
involved the special stem cells in unused fertility&#8209;clinic embryos. The
university claimed there had been death threats to its president. The Board of
Regents had finally decided with a sham show of remorse, to revoke his funding.
They called him in one sunny afternoon in May and pulled the plug. He thanked
them and tore up his contract. By that time he had already demonstrated that,
using the right chemical signals, stem cells could be coaxed into becoming
almost any organ. Inserted into the heart, they became new heart muscle,
replacing scars; inserted into the brain, they became neural tissue. No way was
he going to be stopped now. They didn't know what they were losing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What he needed was a &quot;white knight.&quot; He did some
poking around and came up with Winston Bartlett, then floated feelers to </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s people. What if, he proposed, </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> acquired the Gerex Corporation for
BMD and made it a for&#8209;profit business? No more public funding (and
maddening administrative meddling). The research already completed was so close
to a payoff, after years and years of grinding lab work and thousands of white
mice, that the deal could be considered an investment where 95 percent of the
seed money had already been supplied by taxpayers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Winston Bartlett had liked the sound of that, and Karl Van de
Vliet had his white knight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Once his financing was secure, he decided to begin by solving
the problem that had dogged him at Stanford. Since there would always be a
distracting public&#8209;relations problem hounding any researcher in the
United States who made use of aborted embryos, even if it was to save lives, he
was determined to find a less controversial way to trick Mother Nature and
garner &quot;pluripotent&quot; stem cells, the name given those that could give
rise to virtually any tissue type.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He had. After he moved his research team into the Dorian
Institute just over 4 1/2 years ago, he had perfected a way to use a human
protein, an enzyme called telomerase, to make adult stem cells do most of the
miracles once only thought possible with embryonic cells.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The phase&#8209;three clinical trials over the past seven
months had proved conclusively that the technique worked. Adult stem cells,
when treated with the telomerase enzyme to arrest the process of cell
senescence, could indeed regenerate everything from the human brain to the
human heart, from Parkinson's to acute myocardial infarction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Twenty&#8209;three days from now, when the phase&#8209;three
clinical trials were formally scheduled to be completed, Karl Van de Vliet
would have enough data for the National Institutes of Health to confirm one of
the most important breakthroughs in the history of medicine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Unfortunately, however, there was that other bit of data that
he would not be sharing with the NIH. The Beta.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Thinking about that, his heart heavy, he turned back to the
situation at hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Emma, you're making wonderful progress,&quot; he
continued on with the banter, &quot;but don't push yourself too hard just
yet.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She laughed, sending lines across her forehead. Her voice was
deep and rich, sultry in its own way. &quot;When you get as old as I am, honey,
you do anything you can get away with. What am I saving it for? I just might go
to </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Atlantic City</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> next week and pick up a
sailor.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, then, I may have to have Shelly go along and keep
an eye on you,&quot; he said with one last programmed smile. Then he checked
his watch. </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> should be arriving any minute now.
Time to get Emma Rosen the hell out of here and back upstairs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He turned and signaled for Ellen O'Hara, the head nurse, to
start removing the suction&#8209;cup electrodes that had been stuck on Emma for
her EKG. Ellen had been with him when he was at Stanford and her loyalty was
unquestioned. She had made sure that the Beta disaster with Kristen hadn't
become the gossip of the institute. Still, how much longer could it be kept
quiet?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Sandra</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> Hanes, the lively, dark&#8209;haired
woman in charge of the second floor for this shift, walked into the examination
room. She knew nothing about Kristen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Perfect timing,&quot; he said. Then he drew her aside.
&quot;Keep an eye on Emma, will you? Try and keep her in her room and quiet as
much as you can. The last blood work showed her white&#8209;cell count over
twelve K/CMM. It could mean there's some minimal rejection rearing its head.
Probably nothing to worry about, but can you just keep her away from the stairs
for godsake? I don't want her tiring herself out.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll tie her to the bed if I have to,&quot; </span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Sandra</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> answered. The clinical trials had required a mountain
of paperwork, and her face was strained from working long shifts, including a
lot of weekends, like this one. But he suspected she actually appreciated the
overtime. She was forty&#8209;five, divorced and putting a straight&#8209;A
daughter through </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Rutgers</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She also was a first&#8209;rate nurse, like all the others at
the institute, and her loyalty couldn't be more secure. Still, he knew that she
and all the other staffers were bursting to tell the world about the miracles
they'd witnessed. That was why </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> had insisted on an ironclad
nondisclosure agreement in the contract of every employee to be strictly
enforced. (And to put teeth into the security, all employees were body&#8209;searched
for documents or cameras or tapes on the way in and out.) To violate it would
be to open yourself to a life&#8209;altering lawsuit. During World War II the
claim had been that &quot;loose lips sink ships.&quot; Here they would render
you a pauper for life. Nobody dared even whisper about the spectacular success
of the clinical trials.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As the examining room emptied out, he checked his watch one
more time. Winston Bartlett was due any minute now and he had nothing but bad
news for the man.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Trying to control his distress, he walked to the end of the
hallway and prepared to enter the lab. Whereas the ground floor and the two
above were for reception, common dining, and individual rooms, the basement
contained the laboratory, his private office, the examination rooms, and an OR
(never yet used, thankfully). There also was a sub&#8209;basement, accessible
only through an elevator in the lab or an alarmed set of fire stairs. It was an
intensive&#8209;care area, and it was where Kristen, the Beta casualty, was
being kept.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He zipped a magnetic card through the reader on the door and
entered the air lock. The lab was maintained under positive pressure to keep
out the slightest hint of any kind of contaminant. It was as sterile as a
silicon chip factory.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The room was dominated by a string of black slate
workbenches, then rows and rows of metal shelves with tissue&#8209; containing
vials of a highly volatile solvent cocktail he had engineered especially for
this project, along with a computer network and a huge autoclave and several
electron microscopes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He walked in and greeted his research team. He'd managed to
keep the core group that had been closest to him at Stanford, four people who,
he believed, were among the finest medical minds in the country. They were the
renowned molecular biologist </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>David</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> Hopkins, Ph.D., the strikingly
beautiful and widely published endocrinologist Debra Connolly, M.D., and two
younger staffers, a couple who'd met and married at his Stanford lab, Ed and
Beth Sparks, both Ph.D.'s who'd done their postdoc under him. They all were
here now in the wilds of northern </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>New Jersey</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
because they knew they were making medical history.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
 color:windowtext'>David</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
was waiting, his long shaggy forelock down over his brow as always. But his
eyes told it all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Karl, </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s blood work from yesterday just got
faxed up from the lab at </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Princeton</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. His enzyme level has increased
another three point seven percent.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Damn.&quot; It was happening for sure. &quot;Did you
run—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The computer simulation? A one&#8209;standard&#8209;deviation
estimate is that he's going to go critical sometime between seventeen and
nineteen days.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The Syndrome.&quot; Van de Vliet sighed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just like Kristen.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She faked us out. There were no side effects for
weeks.&quot; Van de Vliet shook his head sadly as he set his handheld Palm
computer onto a side table. Later he would transfer all the day’s patient data
into the laboratory's server, the Hewlett&#8209; Packard they all
affectionately called the Mothership. Then he began taking off his white coat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> looks to be inevitable now.&quot; </span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>David</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> exhaled in impotent despair. The frustration and the
tension were getting to everybody. They all knew what was at stake. &quot;It's
in two and a half weeks, give or take.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What had supposedly been a cosmetic procedure had gone
horribly awry. Van de Vliet wondered if it wasn't the ultimate vengeance of the
quest for something you shouldn't have.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;His AB blood type is so rare. If we'd just kept a
sample before the procedure, we'd have something to work with now,&quot; Van de
Vliet said sadly. &quot;We still might be able to culture some
antibodies.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He hadn't told his research team yet about the other possible
option—using somebody else as an AB blood&#8209;type incubator.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>His last&#8209;ditch idea was to find a patient with a blood
type of AB positive and introduce a small quantity of the special Beta
telomerase enzyme into them. The theory was that this might induce their body
to produce compatible antibodies, which could then be extracted and cultured in
the laboratory. If a sufficient quantity could be produced they could be
injected into </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> and hopefully arrest the enzyme's
pattern of entering the host's bloodstream and metastasizing into the more
complex form that brought on the Syndrome. And if it did work, then there might
even be some way to adapt the procedure to Kristen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Karl, if Cambridge Pharmaceuticals finds out about the
Beta fiasco, how's it going to affect—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How do you think it's going to affect the sale? If this
gets out, there'll be no sale. To anybody. </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
will be ruined, and Gerex along with him. That's everybody here, in case you're
counting.&quot; He turned and exited the lab, pushing pensively through the air
lock, and then he walked slowly toward his office, collecting his thoughts. He
was just passing the elevator when it opened.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

off the elevator, and the sight heartened him as always. The Dutchman was a
genius. If anyone could solve this damned mess, surely he was the one.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think you'd better go down and see for
yourself,&quot; Van de Vliet said slowly. &quot;As I told you on the phone, she
still comes and goes. I think it's getting worse.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
felt a chill run through him. He had once cared for this woman as much as he
was capable of caring for anybody, and what had happened was a damned shame.
All he had intended was to give her something special, something no man had
ever given a woman before.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Will she know who I am? She still did yesterday.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It depends,&quot; Van de Vliet replied. &quot;Yesterday
afternoon she was fully lucid, but then earlier this morning I got the
impression she thinks she's in a different place and time. If I had to guess,
I'd say she's regressing chronologically. I suppose that's logical, though
nothing about this makes any sense.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

was following him back through the air lock and</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>into the

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

scared to death. Van de Vliet and his research team might actually be
criminally liable if the right prosecutor got hold of the case. At the very

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

Just a possibility. He called it the Beta, since it was highly experimental. He
also wasn't sure it was reproducible. But he had inadvertently discovered it
while testing the telomerase enzyme on his own skin over a decade ago.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At the time he was experimenting with topical treatments for
pigment abnormalities, but the particular telomerase enzyme he was working with
had had the unexpected effect of changing the texture of his skin, softening it
and removing wrinkles, a change that subsequently seemed permanent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The idea had lain dormant while they were preparing for the
clinical trials. But then </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s <i>petite amie</i>, the cable&#8209;TV
personality Kristen Starr, had had a career crisis that she blamed on aging,
and he came up with the idea of having her undergo the skin procedure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In a mistake with unforeseen ramifications, she had then been
made an official part of the NIH clinical trials. After she had gone for over a
month without any side effects, </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
had elected to undergo the procedure himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then it began in Kristen—what </span><span style='font-size:
 10.0pt;color:windowtext'>David</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
had solemnly named the Syndrome. Van de Vliet had immediately (and illegally)
terminated her from the clinical trials, removing her from the NIH database.
She was now being kept on the floor below, in the subbasement intensive&#8209;care
area.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As they stepped onto the elevator to go down, </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> found himself wondering how many of
the staff here were aware of the real extent of the crisis. Van de Vliet had
said that only three of the nurses knew about Kristen and the Syndrome.
Fortunately, they all were trustworthy. Two had even been with him back at
Stanford. They would never talk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But what about the rest? They'd all fawned over Kristen,
starstruck by her celebrity, and they'd spill the beans in a heartbeat if any
of them found out. The story would be everywhere from Variety to the &quot;Page
Six&quot; gossip column. It would certainly mean the financial ruin of Bartlett
Medical Devices. If Gerex went under, everything else went with it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>On the other hand, he thought ruefully, what does it matter?
If I end up like her, I won't even know it happened.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;W.B., the telomerase enzyme is completely out of
control in her now,&quot; Van de Vliet continued. &quot;First it metastasized
through her skin and into her blood. Then it began directing its own synthesis.
I've tried everything I know to arrest it, but nothing has worked. I still have
a faint hope, though. If we can make some headway on your own situation . .
.&quot; He paused and his voice trailed off. &quot;In the meantime, though, I
think it would definitely be wise to move her to another location. There are
too many people here. The risk is enormous. Word is bound to get out sooner or
later. You must have someplace . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course.&quot; </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
nodded. &quot;I'd rather have her in the city and closer to me anyway. But let
me see if I can talk to her first. I need to try to make her understand.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Though it's probably too late for that, he told himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They stepped off the elevator and entered a high&#8209;security
area, a long hallway illuminated only with fluorescent bulbs. Using a magnetic
card as a key, </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> opened the first door they came to.
As always, he was dismayed by the sight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>For a moment he just stood looking at the thirty&#8209;two&#8209;
year&#8209;old woman sitting up in a hospital bed, mutely watching a flickering
TV screen showing the Cartoon Network. He had truly cared for her, perhaps even
loved her for a time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he walked over. &quot;Kristy, honey, how're you
feeling?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She stared at him blankly. Kristen had been a vivacious blue&#8209;eyed
blonde who’d had her own showbiz gossip show on the E! channel till it was
canceled during a scheduling shake&#8209;up six months earlier. She had a
nervous breakdown, declaring to </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
that her show had been canceled because she looked like a crone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He’d told her it wasn't true, but if she was so distraught
about her appearance, then maybe there was something he could do for her. Van
de Vliet had once mentioned an experimental skin procedure. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
turned back to Van de Vliet, feeling the horror sinking in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Karl, goddamit, we've got to reverse this.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let's talk outside,&quot; Van de Vliet said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
kissed Kristen's forehead in preparation for leaving. Her lifeless blue eyes
flickered something. He thought it was a flash of some old anger.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Who could blame her? he told himself. But back then, who
knew?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He'd wanted to give her a gift like none other. Not quite the
Fountain of Youth, but maybe a cosmetic version. Her skin would begin to
constantly renew itself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And he'd been right. The promise of having her skin
rejuvenated was just what she'd needed to get her self&#8209;confidence back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>For more than a month the miracle seemed to be working, and
there were no side effects. Her skin was becoming noticeably softer and more
supple. She was elated.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Screw NIH trials and the FDA, he then decided. It was working
for Kristen. By God he would try it himself. He wasn't getting any younger.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But no sooner had he had the procedure too than Kristen
started evidencing side effects. First it was little things, like lapses in
short&#8209;term memory. Next, as it got progressively worse, she could no
longer remember why she was at the institute. Then she couldn't recall her
name, where she lived. And now . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Could it be that God can't be cheated? And when it's tried,
God brings down a terrible vengeance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When they were outside in the hallway, he said, &quot;I have
a place on </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Park Avenue</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> that's empty. At the moment. We used
to spend weekends there and I can arrange for a full&#8209;time nursing staff,
all of it.&quot; He paused. &quot;Has anybody called here about her
lately?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just her mother, Katherine, who's getting pretty
frantic.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The woman is unbalanced. Certifiable. God help us
if—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I told her to see what she could find out from
Kristen's publicist.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Good.&quot; </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
had told Kristen's midtown publicity agent, the nosy Arlene of Guys and Dolls,
Inc., that Kristen had gone to a private spa in </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New Mexico</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'> to rethink her career and didn't want to be disturbed. She
desired complete solitude. Any communication with her would have to be handled
through his office.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He looked at Van de Vliet. &quot;Karl, tell me how bad it is
for me now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;For you?&quot; He hesitated. This was the question he'd
been dreading. &quot;The telomerase numbers from yesterday's blood sample are
not encouraging. As I told you, your topical enzyme application has metastasized
into your bloodstream and started to replicate, just like it did in Kristen.
We're seeing a process known as 'engraftment.' These special cells have learned
to mimic any cell they come near. They become the tissue that those cells
comprise and begin replacing the healthy tissue with new. In Kristen's case, we
think it's now entered her brain and it seems to be supplanting her memory
tissue with blanks. The same side effect could eventually evolve in you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That doesn't begin to describe the real horror, </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> thought. It's too impossible to
imagine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The only thing left is to find some way to cause your
body to reject the enzyme,&quot; Van de Vliet said. &quot;I'm optimistic that
we might be able to grow some telomerase antibodies in another patient with
your blood type, then culture enough of them to stop the Syndrome in its
tracks. It's worth a try. Frankly, I can't think of anything else. But your
blood type is AB, which is extremely rare. Also, the problem is that we'd
possibly be putting that other person at severe risk too.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let's go back up to the lab,&quot; </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> said. &quot;That idea of yours—</span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Hampton</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> thinks he's got somebody. A woman,
in her late thirties.&quot; He put his hand on Van de Vliet's shoulder.
&quot;We're going to get her on board however we have to.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Stone Aimes was staring at the e&#8209;mail on the screen of
his Compaq Armada and feeling an intense urge to put his fist through its
twisted spiral crystals. What do you do when you've come up with an idea that
could possibly save thousands of lives using simple Web&#8209;based technology
and then the piece gets spiked by your newspaper's owners at the very last
minute because it exposes some important New York hospitals to unpleasant (but
constructive) scrutiny?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What it makes you want to do is tell everybody down on the
third floor to stuff it and walk out and finish your book— undistracted by
corporate ass&#8209;covering BS ... or, unfortunately, by a paycheck.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Around him the newsroom of the New York Sentinel, a weekly
newspaper positioned editorially somewhere between the late, lamented New York
Observer and the Village Voice, was in final Sunday countdown, with the Monday
edition about to be put to bed. The technology was state of the art, and the
room flickered with computer screens, blue pages that gave the tan walls an
eerie cast. Composition, spell&#8209;checking, everything, was done by thinking
machines, and the reporters, thirteen on this floor, were mostly in their late
twenties and early thirties and universally underpaid.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The early morning room was bustling, though it felt to Stone
like the end of time. Nobody was paying any attention to him but that was
normal: everybody was doing their own thing. Besides, nobody else realized he'd
just had a major piece killed at the last minute. Now he felt as though he were
frozen in place: in this room, in this job, in this life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The book he had almost finished was going to change a lot of
things. It would be the first major explication of stem cell technology for
general readers. Stem cells were going to revolutionize everything we knew
about medicine and the research was going further than anyone could have
dreamed. The possibility of reversing organ degeneration, even extending life,
was hovering right out there, just at humankind's fingertips. It cried out for
a major book.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He had read everything that had made its way into the medical
journals, but the study that was furthest along was privately funded and now
cloaked in secrecy. It was at the Gerex Corporation, whose head researcher was
a Dutch genius named Karl Van de Vliet. The company had been bankrolled by the
medical mogul Winston Bartlett after Van de Vliet lost his funding at Stanford.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Winston Bartlett, of all people . . . but that was another
story.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Thirteen months earlier, the Gerex Corporation had trolled
for volunteers on the National Institutes of Health Web site, referring to a
pending &quot;special study.&quot; The notice suggested the study might be
using stem cell technology in some fashion. If that study was what Stone Aimes
thought it was, it would be the first to use stem cells in stage&#8209;three
clinical trials. Nobody else was even close.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Karl Van de Vliet was the ball game. Unfortunately, however,
his study was being held in an atmosphere of military&#8209;like secrecy. Why?
Even the identities of the participants in the trials were like a state secret.
Since Winston Bartlett owned Gerex, it surely had been ordered by him. You had
to wonder what that was all about.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Whatever the reason, Stone Aimes knew that in order to finish
his book with the latest information he had to get to Van de Vliet. But </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> had forbidden any interviews, and
Gerex's clinic, called the Dorian Institute, was off&#8209;limits to the public
and reportedly guarded with serious security.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But, he thought, perhaps he had just come up with an idea of
how to get around that. . . . </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He stared a moment longer at the dim reflection coming back
at him from the antiglare screen, which now informed him that his cover feature
had been chopped. Truthfully, it was happening more and more; this was the
third time in eight months that a major muckraking piece had been axed. Also,
as he stared at it, the reflection told him he wasn't getting any younger. The
hairline was no longer where it had been in his college photos—it was up about
half an inch—and the blue eyes were sadder, the lines under them deeper.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Still, the tousled brown hair was thick enough, the brow
mostly wrinkle&#8209;free, and he still had hope. He wasn't exactly young
anymore, but neither was he &quot;getting on.&quot; The &quot;Willy Loman&quot;
years remained safely at bay. He was thirty&#8209;nine and divorced, with an ex&#8209;wife,
Joyce, who had departed to be a garden designer in northern </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>California</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, taking with her their daughter,
Amy, on whom he doted. He had a one&#8209;bedroom, rent&#8209;controlled
apartment in the East Nineties, on the top floor of a fashionable brownstone.
He was socially unattached, as the expression goes, but he was so compulsive
about finishing the book that he spent weekends hunched over his IBM Aptiva,
nursing a six&#8209;pack of Brooklyn Lager and writing deathless prose. The
truth was he was lonely, but he didn't allow himself to think about it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He'd always vowed he'd amount to something by forty. And now
it was as much for Amy as for himself. She lived with his ex&#8209;wife near </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>El Cerrito</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>California</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>, and she meant the world to him. The mortifying part was, he
was a week behind with this month's support check. And he knew Joyce needed the
money. It made him feel like a callous deadbeat dad when the real culprit was
an unlucky confluence of inescapable bills. He’d make it up next week, but he’d
sworn he would never let this happen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was why he had a larger game plan. Get out of this
frigging day job and finish the book. The time for that plan to kick in was
approaching at warp speed. This last insult was surely God's not&#8209;so&#8209;subtle
way of informing him that his future was in the freelance world. Every day out
there would be a gamble, but he could write anything he damn well pleased.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There was a parable set down by the ancient Taoist philosopher
Lao Tzu that Stone Aimes reflected on more and more these days. It was the
story of two oxen: One was a ceremonial sacrificial ox who, for the year before
he meets the axe, was feted with garlands of lotus flowers and plied with ox
goodies. The other was a wild ox who had to scrounge in the forest for every
scrap. But, the story went, on the day the ax was to drop, what wouldn't that
ceremonial ox give to change places with that haggard struggling, underfed wild
ox?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That's the one he empathized with. The one who was out there,
half starved but free.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Sentinel was an iron rice bowl that normally never let
anybody go except for grossest incompetence or flagrant alcoholism. On the
other hand getting ahead was all about office politics, kissing the managing
editor's hindquarters, and copying him on every memo to anybody to make sure
nobody else took credit for something you thought of.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>On the plus side, he knew he was a hell of a medical
journalist. There was such a gap between medical research and what most people
knew, the field cried out for a Stephen Hawking of health, a medical Carl
Sagan. The way he saw it, there was room at the top and he was ready for a
major career breakthrough. He had done premed at </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Columbia</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'> before switching to journalism, and these days he read the
Journal of the American Medical Association from cover to cover, every issue,
along with skimming the many other journals now on the web.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The piece that just got cut was intended to show the world
that investigative journalism was alive and well and trying to make a
difference. He'd documented that hospital mistakes were actually the eighth
leading cause of death in the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>United
  States</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. The </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Institute</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> of </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Medicine</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'> estimated that medical errors caused between fifty and a
hundred thousand deaths a year—rivaling the number from auto accidents or AIDS.
(He'd gotten enough data to be able to quantify how many of those deaths were
in leading </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New York</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> hospitals.) Yet there was no federal
law requiring hospitals to report mistakes that caused serious injury or death
to patients.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The reason seemed to be that the medical lobby&#8209;&#8209;he'd
named names—had successfully turned back all attempts by Congress to pass such
a law, even though it was a formal recommendation by the </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Institute</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> of </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Medicine</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>. The problem was, once you admitted you screwed up, you
could get sued.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So there was no formal accountability.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But (and here was the constructive part) if patients' medical
records were put on the Web—everything, even their medications—it could make a
big dent in the all&#8209;too&#8209;frequent hospital medication foul&#8209;ups.
That alone could cut accidental hospital deaths in half.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He'd pitched Jay Grimes, the managing editor, to let him do a
five&#8209;thousand&#8209;word piece for the Sentinel. Jay had agreed and even
promised him the front page. Jay liked him, but since all the real decisions
were made by the owners, not&#8209;so&#8209;affectionately known as the Family,
there wasn't much Jay could do to protect his people. Stone now realized that
more than ever.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The e&#8209;mail on his Compaq's screen was from Jane Tully,
who handled legal affairs for the paper. Apparently, Jay didn't have the balls
to be the hatchet man, so he'd given the job to Jane, who could throw in a
little legal mumbo jumbo for good measure. And she hadn't even had the courtesy
to pick up the phone to do the deed. Instead, she'd sent a frigging e&#8209;mail:<i>
See attached. Corporate says legal implications convey unacceptable risk.
Consider an op&#8209;ed piece. That way the liability will be all yours. Love
and kisses.</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And of course, by &quot;Corporate,&quot; she meant the Family
(or, more likely, their running&#8209;dog attorneys down on </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Nassau Street</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was really too bad about Jane. She was a young&#8209;looking
thirty&#8209;six and had her own legal practice with a large law firm in
midtown, but she always dropped by before her Sunday brunch to answer any legal
questions that might be pending before the Sentinel was put to bed. Stone knew
pretty well how her mind worked. He should. Jane Tully was his former, very
former, significant other.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They d lived together for a year and a half on </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>First Avenue</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> in the East Sixties. But she was
type A (tailored Armani suits and always on time) and he was a type B (elbow
patches and home&#8209;cooked pasta). The denouement had been seismic and full
of acrimony and accusations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So was she killing this major piece out of spite? he
wondered. Just to prove one last time who really had the <i>cojones</i>?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Actually, it would have been nice to think so. That would put
a human face on this gutless travesty. But the attached memo had enough legal
jargon that another reason was immediately suggesting itself. The owners of the
paper, the Family, the fucked&#8209;up twins Harry and Bosco and their mother,
Adeline, the heirs of Edward Jordan, actually were afraid of a lawsuit. The
attachment had the fingerprints of the Family's attorneys all over it. Jane was
just carrying out marching orders.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And sure enough, there at the bottom was a second message,
unsigned and not part of the original memo. She had written clearly ITMB.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was their old code for &quot;I tried my best.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, Jane baby, who the hell knows. Maybe you did.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Damn, it wasn't supposed to be like this. He wasn't trying</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>to be a Carl
Bernstein, for chrissake. For once, all he wanted was to report a story exactly
the way it was, and then try to help. He ultimately wanted to fix, not fault.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He hit a button and printed out a copy of everything, then
minimized the screen, grabbed his jacket, and walked down the hall. Was this
the moment to quit? It was, except he couldn't afford to. He'd never managed to
put enough aside to take off a year and live on air and write and still get
that fifteen&#8209;hundred&#8209;dollar check out to Joyce and Amy every first
of the month.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He got to the bank of elevators and pushed the button for the
third floor and stepped on. The inspection sticker framed just above the
controls actually told the whole saga of why his cover story about sloppy
procedures in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New York</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> and national hospitals had been
killed. The building was owned by Bartlett Enterprises, the real estate holding
company of Winston Bartlett.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Sentinel held a very favorable lease, renewable for
another ten years at only a 5 percent increase when it rolled over in seven
months. The </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Jordan</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> family had gotten it in the early
1990s, when </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New York</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> real estate was still in the toilet
from the stock market crash of '87, and for once Winston Bartlett really
screwed up. Now it was about a fifth of the going price per square foot.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So naturally he was about to do everything he could to break
the lease. He was that kind of guy. The </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Jordan</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
family, owners of the Sentinel, probably figured that a big lawsuit by the AMA
or somebody would overtax their legal budget and give </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> a shot at their soft underbelly.
Thus no boats were to be rocked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The elevator chimed and he stepped off on three. This floor
had subdued lighting and understated birch paneling, pale white, in the
reception area. It was as though power didn't need to trumpet itself. Everybody
knew who had it</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He waved at Rhonda, the receptionist, and strode past. She
glanced up, then said, &quot;Does she know you're coming?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>       She
knew full well he was headed down to see Jane. Unlike most organizations, which
take Sunday off, this was always a big day for the Sentinel, with all hands on
deck.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Thought I'd give her a little surprise.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No kidding.&quot; She was reaching for the phone.
&quot;I think maybe I should—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not necessary.&quot; He was charging down the hall,
feeling knee&#8209;deep in the thick beige carpet. &quot;I've got a feeling
she's expecting me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jane's door was open and she was on the phone. But when she
saw him, she said something abruptly and hung up. He strode through the door,
then slammed it. The decor was bold primary colors, like her take on life.
Explicit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay,&quot; he demanded, &quot;what the hell's going
on? How about the real story?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Love, you know you can't hang the Family out with that
kind of liability,&quot; she declared, then got up and came around her desk and
cracked open the door half a foot. &quot;And you're the one person here I can't
have a closed&#8209;door meeting with. It'll just get people talking again.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Good. Let the world hear. It's time everybody on this
floor learned what a bunch of gutless owners we have.&quot; He watched the
crisp way she moved, picture&#8209;perfect inside her deep blue business suit,
complete with a white blouse and a man's red tie. Seeing her here, hair clipped
short, glasses, in an office brimming with power, you'd never guess she liked
nothing better than to be handcuffed during sex.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Stone, have you ever considered growing up?&quot; She
settled back into her chair. The desk was bare except for her notebook
computer, an expensive IBM ThinkPad T25. Power all the way. &quot;The Family's
attorneys are just trying to keep us from getting dragged into court. At least
until we can get the paper's lease on this building renewed. We're going to need
to focus on that negotiation, not be distracted by some massive libel suit
brought on by an irresponsible, mudslinging piece. You practically accused the
AMA of bribery, and you named three senators. One from </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New Jersey</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, for chrissake. Stone, there might
be a time for that, but this is not it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This was exactly the reason he'd expected. What it really
meant was, the Family was scared stiff of Winston Bartlett. They figured he was
going to go to court to try to break the Sentinel's lease.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let me ask you a question. Whatever happened to
journalistic ethics around here? Remember that Statement of Purpose they have
everybody sign before they could be hired. 'All the news, without regard'. . .
you know. We were both so damned proud to be a part of that. Now you're helping
them kill anything that's the slightest bit controversial. Is that what we've
come to?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Stone, what the New York Sentinel has come to is to try
and stay out of legal shit till their lease is renewed.&quot; She brushed an
imaginary lock of hair from her face, a residual gesture she once used to stall
for time when she actually did have long hair. &quot;Just let it go, won't you?
To get the signed and notarized documentation we'd need to run that piece—
assuming we even could—would cost a fortune in time and resources.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, he told himself, there was possibly something to that,
from a legal standpoint. But this was not the moment to let sweet reason run
riot.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, look, if you or the Family, or whoever the hell,
believe I'm going to go quietly, you'd better get ready for some revisionist
thinking. If this piece gets spiked, after all the work I put into it—and
dammit, Jane, you know I can document everything I write; that's the way I
work—then I bloody well want something back from this gutless rag. Actually,
it's something I want from you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're not really in a position to—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, don't try to ream me twice in the same
morning.&quot; He walked around her desk and gazed down at the street. The
Sunday&#8209;morning traffic was light. He also noticed that there was a public
phone on the corner. Good, he'd be using it in about eight minutes. Then he
took a moment to reflect on how nice it was to actually have a window. Of any
kind. &quot;You know the saying, the pen is mightier than the sword. I'm about
to prove that once and for all, but there's something I need I need a half
hour’s face time with one of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s employees. A certain Dr. Karl Van
de Vliet. He runs a company that </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
bought out, called the Gerex Corporation. Strictly for fact&#8209;checking.
They've got some important clinical trials going on at a clinic in </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New Jersey</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> that I need to hear about.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She looked at him in sincere disbelief.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Stone, how on earth am I supposed to—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You talk to the Family's lawyers. They've gotta be
talking to </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s attorneys by now. Make it
happen.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And why exactly—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Because I have a book contract, Jane. And in the
process I need to find out everything there is to know about Winston Bartlett's
biggest undertaking ever. He has bankrolled something that could change the
face of medicine.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're doing a book about </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>?&quot; Her astonishment continued
growing and appeared to be genuine. &quot;Jesus, you didn't tell—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hello. That's because who or what I write about on my
own dime is nobody's effing business around here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now he was thinking about Winston Bartlett and wondering why
he'd never told her the most important piece of information in his life. It was
how he was connected to the man. He often wondered if maybe that was why he was
doing this book on stem cells, knowing that half of it would end up being about
Bartlett's self&#8209;serving, take&#8209;no&#8209;prisoners business career.
His infinite cruelty. Was the book actually revenge?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know you'll have to get permission to reprint
anything you've published in the Sentinel. The paper owns the rights to—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Didn't you hear me?&quot; He smiled. &quot;It's a book.
My book. There's no editorial overlap.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who's the publisher?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They exist, trust me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>His small publisher wasn't exactly Random House, but they
were letting him do whatever he wanted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It didn't start out being a book about Bartlett, per
se,&quot; he went on, &quot;but now he's becoming a central figure, because of
what's going on—or possibly not going on—at Gerex.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was losing her famous poise.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What . . . what are you writing?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The end of time. The beginning of time. I don't know
which it is. You see, the Gerex clinic in northern </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New Jersey</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> has clinical trials under way on
some new medical procedure involving stem cells. At least that's what I think.
They've clamped down on the information, but I believe Van de Vliet, who's the
head researcher there, is perilously close to one of the most important
breakthroughs in medical history. I just need to get all this confirmed from
the horse's mouth.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is that what you want to interview him about?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He was available for interviews until about four months
ago. I actually had one scheduled, but it abruptly got canceled. Bang, suddenly
there's a total blackout on the project. They just shut down their press office
completely. When I call, I get transferred to his CFO, some young prick who
likes to blow me off. For starters, I'd like to know why it's all so hush&#8209;hush.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Stone, private medical research is always proprietary,
for God's sake. Sooner or later he undoubtedly hopes to patent whatever he's
doing. A privately held corporation doesn't have to report to anybody, least of
all some nosy reporter.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was true, of course. But Stone Aimes knew that the only
way his book would be the blockbuster he needed to get free of the Sentinel was
to tell the real story of what Gerex was in the process of achieving. And to be
first doing it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>For which he needed access.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Make it happen. Because, like it or not, Winston
Bartlett is about to be the subject of a major volume of investigative
journalism. I've already got a lot of what I need.&quot; That wasn't precisely
the case, but there was no need to overdo brutal honesty. &quot;The only
question is, does he want it to be authorized or unauthorized? It's his
choice.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Winston Bartlett, Stone knew all too well, was a man who
liked nothing better than to see his name in the papers. In fact, he used the
free publicity he always managed to get with his jet&#8209;setting lifestyle to
popularize his various business ventures. Like Donald Trump, he had made
himself a brand name. So what was going on here? Was he just playing his cards
close to the chest, waiting to make a dramatic big announcement? Or was he
keeping this project secret because he was worried about some competing
laboratory beating him to a patent?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Or was he hiding something? Had the clinical trials out in </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New Jersey</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> gone off the track? Was he keeping
the project hush&#8209;hush because something was going on he didn't want the
public to hear about? Had stem cell technology turned out to be an empty
promise? Or had there been some horrible side effect they didn't want reported?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So could you just raise this with his attorneys?
Because if he lets Van de Vliet talk with me directly, he can be sure I'll get
the story right. We can do this the easy way or the hard way. It's up to
him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Stone, I hope you have an alternative career track in
the advanced stages of planning. Because the minute the Family gets wind of
this, that you're writing some tell&#8209;all about </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, they're going to freak. Even if
you're doing it on your own time, you still work here. At least for the moment.
Your name is associated in the public's mind with the Sentinel.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He knew that, which was why this was going to be all or
nothing.</span></p>

the last thing I'll ever ask of you.&quot; He was turning to walk out.
&quot;And look on the bright side. When the Family finally sacks me for good
and all, you won't have to write me any more nasty memos telling me to be a
good boy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He walked to the elevator and took it down. The next thing he
had to do was make a phone call, and this was one that required a pay phone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He'd thought about it and decided one possible way to
encourage </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> to open up was to try to bluff him,
to make the man think he knew more about the clinical trials than he actually
did. There was only one way he could think to do that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In premed days Stone Aimes had shared a dorm room at </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Columbia</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> with Dale Coverton, who was now an
M.D. and a deputy director at the National Institutes of Health. His office was
at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>One of the nice things about having friends who go way back
is that sometimes, over all those years, something happens that gives one or
the other a few chips to call in. Such was the case with Stone Aimes and Dale
Coverton.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Dale's oldest daughter, Samantha, a blond&#8209;haired track
star and math whiz, had—at age thirteen—developed a rare form of kidney cancer
and needed a transplant. She was given six months, tops, to live.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Stone Aimes had done a profile of her in the paper he worked
for then, the New York Globe, and he'd found a transplant donor, a young girl
on Long Island with terminal leukemia, who was able to the knowing she'd saved
another person's life. The two had met and cried together, but Samantha was
alive today because of Stone Aimes. It was a hell of a chit to call in, and
he'd sworn he never would, but now he felt he had no choice. The truth was,
Dale Coverton would have walked through fire for him. The question was, would
he also violate NIH rules?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Stone hoped he would.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He stopped at the pay phone at the corner of </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Park and Eighteenth Street</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, an area where nine people out of
ten were wearing at least one item of clothing that was black. It also seemed
that six out of ten who passed were talking on cell phones. He took out a prepaid
phone card and punched in the access number and then the area code for </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bethesda</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Maryland</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>, followed by Dale's private, at&#8209;home number. It was,
after all, Sunday morning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, Atlas, how's it going?&quot; That had been Dale's
nickname ever since he lifted two kegs of beer (okay, empty) over his head one
balanced on each hand, at a Sigma frat blast their senior year. It now seemed
like an eternity: for Dale, two wives ago, and for Stone, one wife and two live&#8209;togethers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, Truth and Justice, over and out.&quot; It was
their all&#8209; purpose old code phrase for &quot;I aced the quiz. I hit with
the girl. I'm doing great.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My man, I need some truth,&quot; Stone said.
&quot;Justice may have to wait.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A big delivery truck was backing up against the sidewalk, its
reverse&#8209;gear alarm piercing and deafening. The mid&#8209;morning sun was
playing hide&#8209;and&#8209;seek with a new bank of clouds in the south.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That thing you told me about? Is that it?&quot; Dale's
voice immediately grew subdued. He was a balding blond guy with just enough
hair left for a comb&#8209;over. Beyond that, his pale gray eyes showed a
special kind of yearning. He wanted truth and justice to prevail.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't do anything that won't let you sleep nights. But
this situation is very special. I was hoping I wouldn't have to come to you
about what we talked about last month, but I'm running out of time and
ideas.&quot; He paused, listening to the sound of silence. &quot;I suppose it's
too much to ask.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, I still haven't seen any data or preliminary
reports. The NIH monitor for those particular clinical trials is a woman called
Cheryl Gates and she's not returning anybody's phone calls. The truth is, she
doesn't have to. But another possibility is, she doesn't actually know beans
and she's too embarrassed to admit it. If somebody wants to keep a monitor in
the dark for strategic commercial reasons, it's easy enough to do.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, how about the other thing? The thing we talked
about. The list?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He sighed. &quot;I was afraid you might come to that. That's
a tough one, Truth and Justice.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, you know I didn't want to ask. But I'm running out</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>of
cards.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He sighed again. There was a long silence and then, &quot;You
know you're asking me to give you highly restricted access codes to the NIH Web
site. We shouldn't even be talking about it. So officially the answer is no. That's
for the record.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Strictly your decision.&quot; But he had his fingers
crossed, even as he was ashamed of himself for asking in the first place.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe this is God's way of letting me even up things a
bit. It can't be something easy or it doesn't really count, does it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I could end up knowing more about these trials than the
NIH does,&quot; Stone said. &quot;Because it doesn't sound like you guys
actually know much at all.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let me think about it and send you an e&#8209;mail
tonight. Whatever comes up, it'll be 'scrambled eggs.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Thanks, Atlas.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Scrambled eggs&quot; was a reference to a made&#8209;up
code system they'd used in college. A name or number was encoded by interlacing
it with their old phone number. This time the interlaced number would be an
access code for proprietary NIH data.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I do not think I'm long for the world here at the
Sentinel. We're forming a mutual hostility society.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I sure as hell hope you've got a new career concept
ready for the day when they give you the ax.&quot; Dale's attempt at a light
tone did not quite disguise his concern.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Funny, but that's the second time I've received that
advice in the last half hour. I deem that unlucky.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Stone, sometimes I think you ought to try not living
your life so close to the damned edge. Maybe you ought to start practicing a
little prudence, just to see what it feels like.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm that wild ox we used to talk about I like to
scrounge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>But I also
like to look around for the biggest story I can find. I'm trying to get an
interview with a guy on </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s staff. Maybe our 'scrambled eggs'
will flush him out.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just take care of yourself and keep in touch.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You too.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And they both hung up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Was this going to do the trick? he wondered. As it happened
Stone Aimes already knew plenty about </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s
business affairs. He had been a lifelong student of Bartlett the man, and as
part of his research into the Gerex Corporation he had pulled together an up&#8209;to&#8209;date
profile of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s cash&#8209;flow situation. If you
connected the dots, you discovered his financial picture was getting dicey.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
was overextended and, like Donald Trump in the early 1990s, he needed to roll
over some short&#8209;term debt and restructure it. But his traditional lenders
were backing away. He had literally bet everything on Van de Vliet. If his
research panned out, then there was a whole new day for Bartlett Enterprises.
That had to be what he was counting on to save his chestnuts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The funny thing was, </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
didn't really like to spend his time thinking about money. One of his major
preoccupations was to be in the company of young, beautiful women, usually
leggy models.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
also had an estranged wife, Eileen, who reportedly occupied the top two floors
of his mansion on </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Gramercy</span><span

Rumor had it she was a paranoid schizophrenic who refused to separate or give
him a divorce. She hadn't been photographed for at least a decade, but there
was no reason to think she wasn't still alive and continuing to make his life
miserable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Another tantalizing thing to know about Winston Bartlett was
that he had bankrolled a Zen monastery in upstate </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New York</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> twenty years ago and went there
regularly to meditate and recharge. He had once claimed in a Forbes interview,
that the monastery was where he honed his nerves of steel and internalized the
timing of a master swordsman.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Forbes interview was also where he claimed he had quietly
amassed the largest collection of important Japanese samurai swords and armor
outside of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. For the past five years he had been
lobbying the Metropolitan Museum of Art to agree to lend its dignity to an
adjunct location for his collection, and to name it after him. The </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> Collection. Winston Bartlett lusted
for the prestige that an association with the Met would bring him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At the moment some of his better pieces were housed in a
special ground&#8209;floor display in the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
 </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Building</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> in TriBeCa. Most of the collection,
however, was in storage. He had recently bought a building on upper </span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Park Avenue</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> and some people thought he was
planning to turn it into a private museum.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, Stone thought, if the stem cell project works out, he
could soon be rich enough to buy the Metropolitan.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He walked back to the lobby of his building and stood for a
moment looking at himself in the plate glass. Yes, the older he got, the more
the resemblance settled in. Winston Bartlett. Shit Thank goodness nobody else
had ever noticed it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Watching over her condominium building was his day job, but
writing a musical for Off Broadway (about Billy the Kid) was his dream. He was
a tall, gaunt guy with a mane of red hair he kept tied back in a ponytail while
he was in uniform and on duty. Everybody in the building was rooting for him to
get his show mounted, and he routinely declared that he and his partner were
this close to getting backers. &quot;We're gonna have the next Rent, so you'd
better invest now&quot; was how he put it. Alan had the good cheer of a
perpetual optimist and he needed it, given the odds he was up against.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

Then he struck a bold E minor chord on his guitar, like a flamenco fanfare, and
reached to pat her. &quot;Come here, sweetie.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hi, Alan. How's everything?&quot; Seeing him always
bucked Ally up. He usually came on duty while she was out for her run, and she
looked forward to him as her first human contact of the day. He was younger than

way. He was very proud of the new yin and yang tattoos on his respective
biceps. She admired his guts and his willingness to stick to his dream, no matter
the degradation of his life in the meantime.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Doing great, Ms. Hampton. Things are moving
along.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Alan, I've told you a million times to call me
Ally.&quot; Anything else made her feel like a hundred&#8209;year&#8209;old
matron.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, right, I keep forgetting.&quot; Then he nodded at
the manila envelope Grant had just given her. &quot;Pick that up on your
run?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I was ambushed by my ex&#8209;brother. He passed it
along.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What's that mean?&quot; he asked with a funny look.
&quot;Brothers are for keeps.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Unfortunately, you're right, Alan. The whole thing was
long ago. And not far away enough.&quot; She was urging a reluctant Knickers on
through the inner door. &quot;Seeing him just now was sort of like an
aftershock. From a big earthquake in another life.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sounds like you need a hard hat,&quot; he said, and
turned back to his guitar, humming. And dreaming.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She took the elevator up to the top floor and let herself
into her apartment, as always feeling a tinge of satisfaction at where she
lived. Home, sweet home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Her loft&#8209;style apartment was in an idiosyncratic
building whose six&#8209;year&#8209;old renovation had been designed by her old
architectural firm, just before she had to leave and take over CitiSpace. It
was their first big job in the city. She was the one who had designed the large
atrium in the middle and the open glass elevators that let you look out at tall
trees as you went up and down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She loved the building, but at the time she couldn't have
begun to afford an apartment there. Later, when she could, none was available.
Then she heard through the managing agent that a German owner, after completely
gutting his space, had to return to his homeland in a hurry and was throwing it
on the market for half what he’d paid.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

glass bricks that let light through—and installed a &quot;country&quot; kitchen

a central skylight that kept her in touch with the sky and the seasons. In much

style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> it was possible to go for months and
not actually walk on soil. You could completely lose the sense memory of the
feeling of earth beneath your feet. She didn't want to lose the sky too. Since
she couldn't afford a brownstone with a rear garden, the next best thing was to
have a giant skylight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What she really dreamed of was to someday have a vacation
home on the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Caribbean</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> side of the </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Yucatan</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, where she could wake to the sounds
of the surf and play Bach partitas to the seabirds in the coconut palms. She
felt there was something spiritual in the pure sound of a stringed instrument.
It was sweetness and joy crystallized. It went with the sound of surf. They
belonged together.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She had actually researched and designed that dream house
already. The place itself would be based on the Mayan abodes of a thousand
years ago, on stilts with a bamboo floor and a palm&#8209;frond roof to provide
natural ventilation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And since this was all a dream, she could fantasize that
Steve was alive and was there too. Maybe this was her version of the Muslim
Paradise, a land of milk and honey and infinite beauty and pleasure. Sometimes
late at night, when the world was too much with her, she would put on
headphones and a Bach CD and imagine she was on that beach in the </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Yucatan</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, gazing up at the glorious stars.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The other thing she wanted to do someday was memorize the
first violin score of all the Beethoven late quartets. But now any intensive
playing, which was more tiring than it looked brought on chest pains after a
few minutes. Shit. She felt like she was slowly being robbed of everything she
loved. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She decided to stop with the negative thoughts and get ready
for the stressful day to come. She just needed a few quiet moments to get
mentally prepared for it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The first thing she did was give Knickers an early morning
snack, then a fresh bowl of water and a large rawhide chew to occupy her energy
for part of the day. After that, she would shower and change for the trip
uptown.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She had to dress for the rest of the day, which eventually
might include going down to the office, if she had the time and inclination, so
she decided to just throw on jeans and a sweater. She didn't pay any attention
to the envelope Grant had given her; she just tossed it onto the burnt&#8209;tile
breakfast counter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She told herself there wasn't time to look at it now, but she
also realized she had a very serious psychological resistance to opening it.
She hadn't anticipated that just seeing him once more would make her this tense
and angry. His proposition was surely part of some kind of scam. She'd vowed
never to believe him again. It was going to take a lot of persuading to get her
to break that resolve.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Look at it later. Whenever.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She gave Knickers a good&#8209;bye pat and headed out the
door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In times gone by, she took Knickers with her, since her
mother loved to give her sinful sugar treats and fuss over her, but these days
Nina's condition was never predictable. Knickers was one confusing element too
many.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>On the trip uptown she always stopped at Zabar's for some
smoked fish that she could pass off as &quot;kippers&quot; and some buttery
scones. Nina was born in a little place called Angmering&#8209;on&#8209;Sea, in
southern </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>England</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, and she was an unreconstructed
Brit. She insisted on oatmeal (the nutty, slow&#8209; cooked kind) for
breakfast on weekdays and kippers and dark tea on weekends.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now when Ally visited, she never knew what to expect. Some
Sundays Nina could be as spunky as Phyllis Diller, and other times she seemed
to barely recognize her. (Though she sometimes wondered if her mom just acted
that way so she’d leave sooner and let her get back to her Spanish&#8209;language
soaps. She claimed to be watching them to study Hispanic culture, but Ally
suspected the real reason was their racy clothes and plot lines.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And today, on the anniversary of Arthur's tragic death, would
she even remember him? Early&#8209;onset Alzheimer's could proceed at a
frightening pace.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nina had been a notable Auntie Mame kind of figure around </span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Greenwich Village</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> for decades. She smoked Woodbine
cigarettes fiendishly and was forever giving homeless people food and handouts.
She had adopted the garden at St. Luke's and worked there weeding and pruning
and planting and nurturing from late spring to early autumn. As soon as
afternoon tea was completed, she waited an only moderately decent interval
before her first scotch and soda. Room temperature. No ice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;One should have a little something, shouldn't
one?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Arthur joined her to have a cocktail after work once in a
while, but mainly he successfully kept his mouth shut about her smoking and
drinking. Everyone knew she was destined to live to a hundred. Cancer was
surely terrified to go near her. But then the Alzheimer's struck.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>One of Nina's greatest gifts was an unerring BS detector. She
had been skeptical about Grant since he was in his twenties. She deemed him a
hollow suit, full of vapid ambition. She also believed his irresponsible
behavior was a contributing factor to Arthur's death, though she did not have
the same ferocity of feeling about it that Ally did. She had had him pegged as
a no&#8209;goodnik for so long that she already had zero expectations about his
character.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In any case, Grant contributed nothing to the care of Nina
and that suited Ally just fine. As part of the post&#8209;tragedy financial
restructuring, she sold their </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Greenwich
 Village</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> condo, which
was too big and too full of memories for Nina to continue living there. She
then found her a rent&#8209;regulated one&#8209;bedroom apartment in a
wonderful old building on Riverside Drive, and when Nina's early&#8209;onset
Alzheimer's progressed to the point where she couldn't really be relied upon to
take proper care of herself, she arranged for a very conscientious and
sprightly woman from the Dominican Republic to be her full&#8209;time
caregiver.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Maria was devoted to Nina, and Ally didn't know anyone who
could have been more nurturing. She had been there for nine months and she also
used Nina's space to baby&#8209;sit periodically for her daughter, Natalie, who
had a darling five&#8209; year&#8209;old son. What would the next stage be,
Ally wondered fearfully, and would her mother's medical insurance pay for it,
whatever it was? She didn't know the answer and she was terrified.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Aging. It was nature's process to make way for the new, but
why did the last act have to be so cruel? Seeing her mother this way made her
sometimes think that perhaps Arthur was luckier than anyone knew. He'd managed
to miss out on having to watch the woman he loved go into a humiliating
decline.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then she thought about her own mortality, the heart condition
that refused to get any better. Dr. Ekelman had never been more serious. Slow
down, take it easy, watch out for warning signs. She'd said everything except
start saving up for a transplant. Or maybe she was just postponing that
announcement as long as possible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Dammit, why couldn't she do something to make her heart
stronger? That was the most frustrating part of all. The rest of her body could
still have run a mile before breakfast. She could traipse all over lower </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Manhattan</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> Saturdays, shopping for herbs in </span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Chinatown</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> and shoes in </span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>SoHo</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. Damn. Why wouldn't her heart get with the program?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Half an hour later, a big Zabar's bag on the seat beside her,
she found a space for her </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Toyota</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> right on </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Riverside Drive</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, just across from the park. She took
a final look at the sky, which was bright and blue and cheerful, and then, bag
in hand, she headed up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nina's building was a dark brick prewar and had no doorman,
though the super's apartment was right off the lobby, allowing him to receive
packages and generally keep an eye on comings and goings. To Ally, the bland,
inevitably tan hallways in many old </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
 color:windowtext'>West Side</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
buildings had a musty quality to them that always left her depressed. But her
mother’s eighth&#8209;floor apartment was light and airy—after Ally had had it
remodeled and redecorated—and she couldn't have wanted a more cheerful home.
The wallpaper was a light floral pattern and the overstuffed furniture was
buried in enough pillows to please Martha Stewart. And in the living room there
was the piano her mother once played, now covered with photos from happier
times, and a stereo system with a turntable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When she buzzed Maria came to the door with an unusually
bright smile.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Great! Ally could always tell immediately from Maria's face
whether her mom was having a good day or bad day. Today, she knew immediately,
was going to be good.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Miss Hampton, she was asking about you, wondering when
you'd get here,&quot; Maria said. &quot;She remembered this is the day you
come.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Maria was half a head shorter than Ally, and her hair was
dyed a defiant black. She had an olive complexion and her fine features made
her a handsome woman for late fifties. She always wore bold silver jewelry that
might have done more for her daughters than for her, but Ally liked the spunky
persona that went along with too many accessories. She still had a trace of her
Spanish accent even after all the years in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>New York</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.
On days when her mother was cognizant, Maria was the perfect companion for her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally handed over the Zabar's bag and walked in. &quot;Hi,
sweetie.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nina was on the lounger, where she spent most of her waking
hours. Yes, she was definitely having a good day today. She'd done a full
makeup number.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Her face could only be described as youthful, no matter that
she was past sixty&#8209;five. She had elegant cheekbones and a mouth that was
still sensuous. And her blue eyes remained lustrous, though nowadays they often
seemed to be searching for something, or someone, no longer there. She had a
colorist come in every three weeks to keep her hair the same brunette it had
always been, and that had a way of making Ally fantasize she hadn't aged at
all. Ally also felt—hoped—she might be looking at a spitting image of herself
some decades hence. You could do a lot worse.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The TV was on, sound turned low, and her mother was staring
at the multihued screen. Probably the tape of a Spanish&#8209;language soap
she'd somehow missed. Three cosmetic&#8209;heavy women in deeply cut blouses
were arguing, all appearing either angry or worried or both.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In times past Nina was always starting some new project,
claiming that was how she kept her mind alert. She had taught herself French
and had a very good accent, particularly for a Brit. Just before the
Alzheimer's hit, she decided to try to learn Spanish, as something to divert
her mind and keep it active. She also wanted to be able to chat with the
increasingly Hispanic workforce in restaurants and delis.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now, though, Ally thought her mom was continuing the language
study as part of a program of denial. Nina knew her mind was being stripped
from her, but she was determined to try to wrestle it back by giving herself
mental challenges. The struggle was hopeless, of course, but her spirit refused
to admit that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally bent down and kissed her clear white forehead.
&quot;Hey, how's it going?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Look at those pathetic creatures,&quot; she declared,
only barely acknowledging Ally's presence. &quot;If boobs were brains, they'd
all be Einstein. In my day women knew how to make themselves attractive.
Simplicity. Less is more.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Yep, Ally thought, this is going to be a good day. She's
obviously spent an hour on makeup. For all her complaining she probably watches
Maria’s soaps at least in part to glean cosmetic tips. Who knew, maybe she was
learning Spanish too, like she claimed. Dear God, let her do it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Maria was looking into the Zabar's bag. &quot;Oh, she's going
to love this. Could you come in the kitchen and help me fix a tray?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That's strange, Ally thought. Maria thinks I'm all thumbs
around food preparation and she never wants me in the kitchen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The apartment was old enough that the kitchen was a separate
room with an open doorway. When they stepped inside, Maria set down the bag and
turned to her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There was a man here yesterday. I never saw him before.
He said he was your brother. Is that true?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally felt a chill go through her body.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your mother seemed to know him,&quot; Maria went on,
&quot;but I wasn't sure whether she might have just been pretending. Sometimes
you never know what she gets or doesn't get. She's a good faker.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What... what did he want?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, the first thing seemed to be that he wanted to
ask your mother a question about you. Then he started trying to talk her into
going to some clinic out in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New
  Jersey</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, where they
might be able to help ... her mind.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Shit. What is he up to? Is he trying to get to me through
Nina?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You said he asked Mom a question about me? What—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What are you two whispering about?&quot; came a voice
from the doorway.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All kinds of secrets.&quot; Ally glanced up and smiled.
&quot;Maria was just telling me about a visitor you had yesterday, Mom. Do you
remember if anyone came to see you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Pish. Of course I remember. Seth. But sometimes I think
I'd just as soon not.&quot; She stared at Ally, those searching blue eyes
boring in. &quot;Do you ever see him anymore?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Funny you should ask, she thought.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then she wondered, why not tell the truth? She couldn't think
of any reason not to.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As a matter of fact, Mom, Grant came by my building
this very morning. I hadn't seen him in ages. He called and said he wanted to
meet me while I was out running. I told him to bug off, but he came anyway. He
wanted me to... Let's just say he's still wheeling and dealing.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nina looked at her for a long moment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He showed up here yesterday morning, darling, out of
the blue. After all those years when he didn't give a shit— excuse my Francais.
I acted like I didn't quite know who he was, but I got every word. He's still
spending his salary on clothes. He talked a lot, saying he knew a man—a doctor
with some kind of experimental treatment—who could turn back the clock on my
... or at least stop it. He could give me a chance to take my mind back. And
then he left his card. He wanted me to talk to you about it and then call him
back.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Grant, you bastard. You didn't say a word about any of this.
What're you trying to do?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No need for rocket science. He was using Nina as bait. This
was his way to make sure she was dragged into whatever shenanigans he was up
to. If he got Nina out to that place in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>New Jersey</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>,
whatever it was, it would be like he had a hostage.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was so angry she was gasping for air. And she felt that
damned tightness in her chest coming on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I told Maria to throw the card away,&quot; Nina went
on, &quot;but then I got to wondering. What if it's true?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You don't really think—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course not,&quot; Nina declared, but Ally wasn't
sure how much she meant it. &quot;Probably he just needs money. That'll come
next. I'd guess he's hoping I'll give him a 'down payment' for this
'treatment,' whatever it is. That's surely what's going on. Trying to take
advantage of a senile old woman.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nina didn't appear to be fooled. Or was she? Sometimes she
did her thinking out loud before coming to a conclusion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Seth may be barking up the wrong tree with me,
Ally,&quot; she went on. &quot;I'm not sure I want any of his miracle cures.
I've lived my life. I'm tired.&quot; She looked away. &quot;When you're young,
you never think about what it's like to be old. But then when you do get old
you somehow can't imagine being young again. Having to do it all over...&quot;
Her voice trailed off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Yes, Ally thought, you’ve had plenty of pain you wouldn't
want to relive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nina sat back down on her flowered chaise and closed her
eyes. &quot;Do you know what day this is?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I was hoping you'd remember.&quot; She reached and
grasped her hand. &quot;It's been five years today. Exactly.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I still have nightmares about it, the horror, &quot;
Nina said, her eyes still closed &quot;but he did it for me, you know. He
thought the insurance was all that would save me. And then when it didn't . . .
So now we've got to hang on with all we've got. For him.&quot; She opened her
eyes and looked directly at Ally. &quot;One day soon, maybe sooner than we think,
I'm going to be mad as a hatter. Time, Ally, time has played a cruel joke. God
the Prankster is keeping me in physical health so I can experience every step
of my own degradation.&quot; Then she glanced back at the Spanish soap and went
on. &quot;I hope you know how to enjoy life, while you're still full of it.
Don't miss a minute.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm going to try, Mom.&quot; Ally squeezed her hand
again and for that moment sensed Nina was her old self. She wasn't going to
tell her about Dr. Ekelman and the latest heart news. But if she did the
response would probably still be the same. <i>Just live life for all it’s
worth. You never know if there's even going to be a tomorrow.</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Would you put on some Janacek?&quot; she said finally,
aiming the remote at the TV and clicking it off. &quot;One of the string
quartets. I've had my fill of Hispanic tarts. I've learned a good deal of
Spanish from them, but sometimes I think understanding what they're saying just
makes it all that much cheaper.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was when Ally realized with a burst of joy that Nina still
had an interior life that she was carefully hoarding. What else was going on in
that mind? The sense of the night closing in? Do not go gentle. Please. Stay
awhile with me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She got up and went over to the record cabinet. Her mother
still had her collection of old 33s, today they were called vinyl, with
conductors from decades ago like Bruno Walter and Arturo Toscanini. She found a
Janacek String Quartet, No. 2, a rare mono pressing by the old Budapest String
Quartet fifty years ago, and put it on the turntable, still loving those first
crackling sounds that raise your anticipation. She remembered how Nina would
put on a record in the evening, after dinner, with room&#8209;temperature
scotch in hand, and make the family sit and listen. She suspected that had a lot
to do with her own desire to play the violin herself someday. And then, in high
school, she started lessons. Better late than never.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now, though, she sensed there was something Nina wanted to
tell her and this was her way of setting the stage.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After the music had played for almost three minutes, Nina
listening with eyes closed as though in a rapture as the movement clawed its
way toward an initial theme in an elusive minor mode, she turned and looked at
Ally.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He didn't tell you he came to see me, did he?
Seth?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I guess he forgot,&quot; Ally said. It was a lie
neither of them believed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've been thinking over all he was trying to say. I
didn't get everything at the time, but I guess my feeble mind was recording it.
Now it's all coming back. He was talking about Arthur and his suicide—Ally, we
both know that's what it was—and how he felt responsible and how he was finally
going to be able to make up for all the harm he'd done to me, and to you. But
he was worried you might not want to go along with this special treatment for
me.&quot; She was studying Ally, as though searching for an answer. Maria had
discreetly departed for the kitchen. &quot;He kept talking about this doctor he
knew. At this clinic. He swore this man could perform a miracle for me. He said
I should do it, whether you approved or not.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally looked at her, wondering what to say. This was getting
too devious for words.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then Nina went on. &quot;I'll probably not remember anything
about this by tomorrow. But I just wanted to tell you. When you get as mentally
addled as I am now, you compensate by developing your other senses, I call it
your sixth sense. And Ally, I think he's involved in something that's evil. And
he wants to draw me into it, maybe both of us.&quot; She stopped carefully
framing her words. &quot;I sensed a kind of desperation about him. I don't know
exactly what it was.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Ally listened the Janacek quartet swelling in the room,
scratches and all, she felt more and more like an utter dunce. She hadn't
caught any of this in Grant's come&#8209;on, but now . . . Nina was right about
that sixth sense.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But what could the real story be? Grant was more a simple con
artist than some embodiment of evil. Think the Music Man in designer threads,
not Darth Vader. Evil was surely too strong a word He was just the consummate
self&#8209;promoting hustler. The troubling part was, he was so damned good at
it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mom, you're wonderful today. Why don't we all three go
somewhere for brunch now? Right now. There's a new French place just down </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Columbus</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> that needs checking out.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She had an eerie foreboding it might be their last chance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, honey, you brought some smoked fish, didn't you?
That's all I want.&quot; Nina dismissed the idea with a wave of her hand.
&quot;Besides, no one in this town knows how to brew a proper pot of tea.&quot;
Then, the next thing Ally knew, she was back to musing out loud about Grant.
&quot;I can't stop wondering. He said this doctor he knows might work a miracle
for me. What am I supposed to think?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally was trying to decide whether a glimmer of hope, even
though it was almost certainly false, might be a healthy tonic for Nina just
now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mom, Grant gave me some materials about that doctor.
I'll read them tonight, I promise.&quot; She was listening to the Janacek
quartet soar, and it was bucking her up. &quot;Let me see what I can find
out.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He wants me to start in right away,&quot; Nina pressed.
&quot;I think he said there are some studies going on at this clinic, but
they're almost over. It's free now, and unless I go soon, I can't get in the
program. He said he would take me out there Monday morning if I wanted. But if
I go with anybody, I want it to be you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He’s such a bastard, Ally thought.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She glanced at Maria, who'd been watching from the kitchen
door and listening to all that had happened. She was looking very upset and she
motioned Ally toward the doorway with her eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let me get a glass of water, Mom.&quot; She headed for
the kitchen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Did you hear all the things she's talking about?&quot;
she asked when they were out of earshot.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Maria nodded. &quot;A lot of what your mother said is true.
It was very strange. At the time she acted like she didn't understand him. Now
I realize she did. Or maybe it all just came back to her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you think is really going on?&quot; Ally was
studying her, hoping to get at the truth. &quot;She seems a lot better
today.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Maria paused a moment. &quot;Miss Hampton, I don't believe
your mother is going to be with us much longer. I saw my own go through much
the same thing. There's always a glimmer just before ...&quot; She looked down
and stopped.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You said Grant asked her something about me.
What—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't think she remembers. He was asking her about
your blood type. It seemed a very strange question.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally couldn't think of any reason why he would be asking
that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maria, what was your impression of him? Overall?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just that he seemed very nervous. Very uneasy.&quot;
She hesitated, as though uncertain how to continue. &quot;He wanted something,
Miss Hampton. That much I'm sure about. But</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>this doctor
he wants to take her to. It sounded to me like he does things that are against
the laws of nature.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Grant wants me to go out to that clinic too.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Whatever you do, just stay close to her,&quot; Maria
said finally, picking up the tray with its smoked fish and teapot covered with
a knit cozy. &quot;She may not have that long.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Maria had a seer's mystical bent that sometimes troubled
Ally. What if she was right? It was moments like this when Ally truly missed
having someone special in her life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The afternoon was waning when Ally finally headed back
downtown. Days like today she couldn't help coining away buoyed, feeling her
mom was going to be cogent forever.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In fact, Ally was more worried about herself just now. About </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>two o'clock</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> she'd started feeling that sensation in her chest
again, but she hadn't wanted her mother, or Maria, to know she was using
vasodilator medication. She casually said her farewells and got down to the car
and was sitting behind the wheel before she popped a nitro tab. She immediately
felt okay again, and as she drove down Broadway, heading for her office, she
reviewed all that had happened.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After their brunch of smoked fish and onion chutney and soda
bread and a pot of double&#8209;strength Earl Grey, she'd tried to sell her
mother on a trip to the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bahamas</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, with Maria joining them. Soon,
maybe at the beginning of summer. She wanted Nina to spend some time thinking
about it, but she didn't want to wait too long. Was this just going to be a
distraction at the end of Nina's life? God, she didn't want to think so. She
wanted to think of it as a rebonding.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nina had always liked to revisit the </span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Devonshire</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> countryside of her childhood in
midsummer—when Arthur could take time off—always for just a week, but it was as
intensively planned as a major military campaign. Her favorite thing was to
trek among the hedgerows and stone fences, making charcoal sketches on opened&#8209;out
brown bags. In the evenings they would dine <i>en famille</i> at a country inn.
They went with local favorites, like kidney pie. Then they would stroll the
country lanes in the moonlight as a family. No TV, and she and Grant hated
everything about the trips. Booooring.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But that was long ago and far away, when she and Grant were
still kids. Now her mom would surely want something restful. And some
guaranteed sunshine wouldn't hurt either. Already she had an idea: why not rent
a house with a private pool, say on </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Paradise</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
 </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Island</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> where Nina could spend a couple of
hours each afternoon in the casino? She'd always loved casinos, and never
missed a chance to hit the blackjack tables if she was anywhere near one. Her
loss limit was a hundred dollars, but she actually beat the house more often
than not. The teatime scotch hadn't impaired her card&#8209;counting skills.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nina appeared to like the idea, so Ally had started making up
a schedule in her head. The beginning of summer would be off&#8209;season in
the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Caribbean</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> and there should be some real
bargains to be had. She made a mental note to ask Glenda, her assertive, gum&#8209;chewing
travel agent at Empress, to start trolling for a package.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What was Ally really thinking, hoping? She was fantasizing
she could heal Nina all by herself. She so desperately wanted to, she had a
premonition she could will it to happen. When she saw her mom on good days, she
always found herself believing she could somehow make all her days good. She
was sure of it, against all odds.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What she wasn't sure about was what her mother really thought
about Grant's proposal to enroll her in this clinic in </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New Jersey</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. Was this doctor's
&quot;miracle&quot; stem cell cure based on a real medical advance, or was he
some kind of charlatan?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The first thing to do was to find out more about this
supposed medical magician, Karl Van de Vliet. The envelope Grant gave her was
still lying there on her breakfast bar, unopened. She told herself she'd read
it the minute she got home tonight, when the day's work was over and she could
concentrate....</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Sunday office. The interior&#8209;design job she had on
her mind was behind schedule and she was feeling a lot of pressure. It was for
a Norwegian couple in their mid&#8209;thirties. He was a software programmer
working in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New York</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s restructured Silicon Alley, and
she was teaching at the Fashion Institute of Technology. Together they pulled
down over 250 thou a year and they'd decided to stop throwing away money on
obscene </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New York</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> rents.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They bought an entire floor, actually three small apartments,
of what was formerly a tenement in the West Fifties, an area once known as
Hell's Kitchen but now much gentrified and renamed </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Clinton</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. They had dreams of an open&#8209;space
loft of the kind made famous in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
 color:windowtext'>SoHo</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
when artists took over abandoned factory buildings and gutted the space, taking
out all the walls.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Because they had combined three apartments, they had to file
their plans with the NYC Department of Buildings and modify the building's
Certificate of Occupancy to reflect the change in the number of dwelling units.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So far so good, but then a woman who was the local member of
the District Council got wind of the project and sent someone from her office
to look over the place. The next day, the Department of Buildings' approval of
their plans was abruptly withdrawn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It turned out that there was an obscure law on the books
concerning Clinton, one that even the Department of Buildings was only vaguely
aware of. It said that in order to preserve the &quot;family character&quot; of
the neighborhood, no renovation could alter the number of rooms in a
residential building. Not the number of apartments, mind you, just the number
of rooms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was when they showed up at CitiSpace in despair. They
wanted Ally to help them by doing some kind of design that would satisfy the
law and also give them the open, airy feeling they had set their hopes on. On
the face of it, their two goals seemed mutually contradictory and impossible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was short and shy and she was plump and sassy and Ally
liked them both a lot. Sometimes in this business she sensed she was helping
people realize their dreams and that was a very rewarding feeling. Real estate
was an emotional thing. Your home was a part of you. She always tried to get to
know people before she did any designs for them. Sometimes design was more
psychology than anything else.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But this time she had to solve a problem before she could wax
creative. If their plan for open space could be stopped by some obscure local
provision that even the Department of Buildings was fuzzy about, then maybe
there was some other obscure law in the Housing Code that could be used to
fight back. The full code had recently been put on the NYC Web site, so she
wanted to go over every page and see what she could come up with. And she
wanted to do it in the office, undisturbed with all the architectural plans
close to hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The office was deserted when she cruised in and clicked on
the lights. She got on the expansive NYC Web site and started poring over the
Housing Code, though she was still obsessing about Nina. What if this doctor in
</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New Jersey</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> actually could do something for her?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Finish here, she told herself, and then go home and read the
guy's CV.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A pot of decaf coffee later, she came across a little&#8209;known
fact, which she now vaguely remembered from her days as a practicing architect.
If you installed a fifteen&#8209;inch drop across a ceiling, that was
technically a wall in the eyes of the NYC Department of Buildings. The space on
each side became a separate &quot;room.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As they say in the movies, bingo.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In fact, why not do a honeycomb ceiling that would actually
simulate the industrial look they were seeking, anyway? The ceiling was over
eleven feet high; there was plenty of vertical space. Nobody would know it was
just a sneaky way to get around a funny local aberration in the Building Code.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I'm brilliant, she thought. Yes! Dad would be proud.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She made some sketches, and by that time it was after six.
Time to go home.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Knickers was waiting by the door, and she gave Ally a dirty
look and some very disapproving barks. By way of penance, Ally took her on an
extra long walk, all the way up to </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Fourteenth Street</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'> and back. Then she picked up some tuna salad and steamed
veggies from a new deli on </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>West
  Tenth Street</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As she settled down to eat at the breakfast bar, she felt
like a single mom, always eating and doing everything on the run—and all she
had to worry about was a friendly dog. How did real working moms do it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was just past nine when she poured a glass of Chardonnay
and picked up Grant's envelope and took it into the living room, pausing to put
some Chopin ballades on the CD player.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The envelope contained a bound folder that was Dr. Karl Van
de Vliet's curriculum vitae, his resume. It was in fact a minibiography that
devoted a page to each of his career turns. His life story was presented from a
god's&#8209;eye view, as though it were a novel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Karl Van de Vliet had done his undergraduate studies at the
prestigious </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>University</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> of </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Maastricht</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'> after which he'd migrated to the </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>United States</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> and taken a Ph.D. in molecular
genetics from the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>University</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> of </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Chicago</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>, top of the class. Following that he went to Yale as a
postdoctoral fellow, again studying genetics.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>From the beginning he focused his research on the mechanisms
that govern human cell reproduction. Along the way he'd become interested in
something known as the Hayflick limit—which concerned the number of times a
cell could divide before it became senescent and ceased to replicate. This
natural life span controlled the aging process of every organism, and it seemed
to be nature's device for nipping undesirable (i.e. mutant) cells in the bud by
never letting any cell, unhealthy or healthy, just keep on replicating
indefinitely.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>However, there were &quot;immortal cells&quot; buried within
us all, so&#8209;called stem cells that could replicate forever, unchanged.
They were present at the very beginning of life and all our differing body
tissue was created from them. Some still lingered on in our body, as though to
be available for spare parts. If one could figure out how to transfer the
characteristics of those cells to other cells, then the possibility existed
that we could regenerate damaged or aging tissue in our vital organs. The trick
was to figure out the mechanism whereby stem cells managed to cheat time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>His research, which was accompanied by a flurry of scientific
papers, was celebrated and encouraging. After three years he was lured away
from Yale to become a faculty member at Johns Hopkins, which offered to double
his laboratory budget. He was there for six years, during which time he met
Camille Buseine, a neurosurgeon finishing her residency.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She had a doctorate from a medical institute near </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Paris</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> and she was doing research that was similar to his,
so the biography said. They married and became a team, and when he was asked by
Harvard Medical to found a department for molecular genetics, she was
immediately offered a tenured position there too. Harvard considered it a
double coup.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>His research was zeroing in on the telomerase protein, an
enzyme many scientists believed was responsible for suppressing the aging
process in stem cells. Could it be used to regenerate tissue?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was well along on the task of exploring that tantalizing
possibility when tragedy struck. Camille, who had worked around the clock during
her residency at Johns Hopkins, began feeling weak at Harvard and was diagnosed
with acquired aortic stenosis. After a 2 1/2&#8209;year struggle, she died
during a severe cardiac episode.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My God, Ally thought, that's what I have.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After Camille died, he left Harvard and its time&#8209;consuming
academic obligations and went to work full&#8209;time at a research institute
affiliated with </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Stanford</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>University</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.
He even formed a paper company to structure the work, the Gerex Corporation.
But then there came a second strike against him. He was doing research using
embryonic stem cells obtained from the discarded embryos at fertility clinics.
After two years of harassment by right&#8209;wing political groups, Stanford
decided his research was too controversial and terminated his funding.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Three months later, Karl Van de Vliet merged his company with
Bartlett Medical Devices and moved his research staff east to </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New Jersey</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, to the Dorian Institute. That was
five years past, and now his research using stem cells was in third&#8209;stage
NIH clinical trials.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The official history ended there, though with a strong hint
that the final chapter was yet to be written. Then at the back there was a
bibliography of publications that extended for eight pages, and included a
summary of the most important papers. His work on stem cells and the telomerase
enzyme appeared to be at the forefront of the field.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Oddly, however, some of his writings also were philosophical,
an argument with himself whether his work could be misused to alter the natural
limitations life imposes. One of those papers, from a conference presentation
in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Copenhagen</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, had a summary, and in it he
pondered whether the use of stem cells to rejuvenate the body might someday
give medical science godlike powers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Greeks, he declared, had a myth about the punishment
reserved for those who sought to defeat our natural life span. When the goddess
of the dawn, </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Aurora</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, fell in love with the beautiful
youth Tithonus and granted him immortality, it turned out to be a curse, since
he still reached the decrepitude of age but had to suffer on forever because he
could not have the release of death.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But, Van de Vliet pondered, if we could find a way to arrest
the aging process in our body's tissue, might we escape the process of aging?
If so, was this a good thing? Or might this be a step too far that would bring
on unintended, and as yet unknown, consequences?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well</span></i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>,
Ally thought, <i>I wouldn't mind having Mom's mind restored. Or my own heart,
for that matter.</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>All in all, Karl Van de Vliet was clearly a genius. He also
was a very complex man. But might he be a very gifted huckster as well?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The inside back cover had a group photo, showing him
surrounded by members of his research staff, all in white lab coats. There were
two men and two women and each was identified, along with a list of his or her
academic credentials. They were standing on the porch of what appeared to be a
nineteenth&#8209;century mansion, which had large Doric columns in Greek
Revival style. The lettering in the marble above their heads read<span
style='text-transform:uppercase'> the dorian institute.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She put down the folder and went into the kitchen and poured
herself another glass of wine, finishing off the botde. Her mind was chinning,
but not because of the words on the page. It was that photograph at the back.
It was dated less than two years ago.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>His Ph.D. at the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>University</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
 of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Chicago</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> was granted in 1962. But even if he
was a genius and got his first doctorate in his early twenties, he’d still have
to be—what? At least sixty years old by now. Probably halfway to seventy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But in the photo, he looks no more than forty, well, forty&#8209;five
at most. What the heck is going on?</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She went back into the living room and picked up the brochure
and stared at it. He had sandy hair that lay like a mane above his elongated
brow. He was tall and gaunt, with high cheeks and deep, penetrating eyes. But
no matter how you gauged him, the guy hadn't aged a day since his forty&#8209;fifth
birthday, tops.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So what’s going on that isn't in the package?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She checked the digital clock on the side table—the hour was
pushing ten—and decided to give Grant a call.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Three chirps, and then, &quot;Yo. </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Hampton</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My God, she thought, he even does it at home. That synthetic
bravado was left over from his trader days: <i>You're the luckiest person
alive, just to have reached me. How can I further make your day?</i> his tone
implied.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Grant, it's me. I think it's time for that vital
chat.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It took him a split second to recover, and then, &quot;Hey, I
was beginning to wonder what happened to you. If you were going to stand me up
or what. Not call, like you said you would.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Long day. I was up at Mom's this morning. You knew she
was going to tell me, right? About your little surprise visit and
proposal?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I had a hunch the topic might arise.&quot; His voice
seemed to shrug nonchalantly. &quot;I thought you should hear it from her
instead of from me. So what do you think?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do I think? I think I'm wondering what you're up
to.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm not 'up to' anything, Ally, except exactly what I
told her. Trouble is, I don't know whether she got it. I wanted to see how she
was doing. You know, I'm thinking maybe Dr. Vee can do something for her. But I
had to see her first. She seemed pretty distant, but that woman there—what was
her name? Marie, Maria, whatever?—said she has lucid moments. So who knows? He
might possibly help her. I think I can arrange to get her into his clinic. </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> gives me a few perks. It's the least
I can do for her, so...&quot; His voice trailed off expectantly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Grant, I need to talk to you about this man. I read the
stuff you gave me and I still don't know the first thing about him.&quot; She
paused, about to speak words she never thought she would. &quot;If you want to
come over, I'll stand you a drink.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You serious?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;For my sins.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll grab a cab. See you in fifteen.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It's begun, she thought. I'm about to let Grant screw up my
life one more time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No. This round, don't give him the chance. Stay ahead of him.</span></p>

bodyguard&quot; he was saying as he strode in the door, a Master of the
Universe with a leather jacket slung over his shoulder. He looked stylish, but
then he always did. He casually tossed the jacket onto the gray couch, then
gazed around. Thankfully, he didn't try the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>New York</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
cheek kiss. &quot;I guess this is not supposed to seem like old times, but
somehow it does. Seeing you again. Hey, we're still blood kin, right?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't push it, Grant.&quot; She'd killed the Chopin and
put on a Bach sonata. Clear, precise thinking was required not sentimentality.
Knickers had rushed to give Grant a hello nuzzle, happier to see him than Ally
was. &quot;Whatever this is, it is definitely not old times.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He sauntered into her kitchen, looking around—trying to act
cool, but clearly ill at ease. &quot;You've done a nice job on this place,
sis.&quot; He was looking over the rustic counter she'd installed. &quot;You
get a deal on the space? A bank repo or something?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The people who had it wanted to sell fast and I made
them an offer.&quot; Not that it was any of his damned business. Why didn't she
treat the question with the scorn it deserved?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She had an old fifth of Dewar's in the cabinet. She poured
him some, over ice, then gave herself a shot of tequila <i>anejo</i>, neat, to
sip. She loved the pure agave flavor. The more she thought about the situation,
the more she was sure she needed it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He picked up his scotch, then walked into the living room and
helped himself to the couch. &quot;Ally, I know why you're ticked. And I don't
blame you. I feel crummy about Dad, I really do. I guess I share some of the
blame.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was trying to sound contrite but the reading did not quite
rise to the minimal threshold of credibility.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You 'share'... with whom, you self&#8209;centered
prick? Nobody else was involved. He mortgaged CitiSpace to the hilt and settled
those fraud suits to keep you from losing your license. Or worse. You destroyed
his business and his life all by yourself.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Look, I thought the business plan I had would work out.
I really did. I was managing discretionary accounts, but the bond market hit a
downdraft when I was long. A few of my clients didn't have the balls to ride it
out. What do you want me to say? That I feel like a complete cretin over what
happened? That a day doesn't go by that I don't hate myself for it?&quot; His
eyes went dead and he seemed to shrivel, his body becoming visibly smaller.
&quot;Well, I do. More than you'll ever know.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You didn't seem all that contrite at the time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I was operating in a high state of denial back then.
But now I want to take a shot at growing up. I want to start trying to make up
for all that, if you'll just cut me a little slack and give me a chance.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Grant, you're working for Bartlett Enterprises, doing
whatever it is you do. Fine. That's your job. But now you want me to become a
guinea pig when this Dutch doctor needs one in a crunch. Or maybe Mom too, for
all I know. Maybe he needs her as well. Two guinea pigs. So don't try to make
this about me and her. Let's keep it honest. It's really about you, just like
always.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ally, a lot of things have gone on since Dad... passed
away. I've changed, in more ways than you could ever imagine.&quot; He was all
sincerity now, his demeanor rapidly evolving to fit the current vibes of the
scene. &quot;I'm not like I used to be. I really mean that. I've learned ...
learned that I can't always just be thinking about myself.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So ... what changed you?&quot; The truth was, he did
seem different. In some way she couldn't quite understand. But he was always
talking about turning over a new leaf, especially whenever he'd just gotten
himself in trouble. That part hadn't changed at all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ally, Dr. Van der Vliet... I don't know how much I
should tell you, but he's a miracle worker.&quot; He paused and looked down at
his scotch. One thing about him was definitely different, she thought. There
was a lot less bravado and swagger. &quot;The thing is, what he's doing is so
powerful. I'm not sure which worries me most—that it's not true, that it's just
some placebo effect, or that it is true. When I think about the implications .
. .&quot; His voice trailed off again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Go on.&quot; She could tell he was dead serious.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's not something I'm sure I should talk about.&quot;
He reached over and touched her hand. &quot;But it's working, I swear. He's
doing things that shouldn't even be possible.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Uh&#8209;huh, she thought, pulling her hand away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Grant, please tell me exactly what you think he could
do for Mom.&quot; She wasn't sure she should be having this conversation.
&quot;You want her to go out to the Dorian Institute, right? Where he does his
'research.' And I take it that's where you want me to go too.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

only want Mom to go if you say it's okay. I'm not trying to do anything behind
your back.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

other word he uttered was probably part of some hustle. But what was it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why don't we start at the beginning, Grant? I read his
CV, and believe me I've got a lot of questions. For starters, how did he
convince Winston Bartlett to bankroll him?&quot; She took another sip of her
tequila, then set it down. &quot;You're his flunky now, so you should be able
to answer that question.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then you know he lost his federal funding at Stanford a
few years back, when he was at a critical stage of his research using stem
cells. That's when he came to the Man and persuaded him to put up the money to
help him take everything private. The only way </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'> would play ball was if he could buy the Gerex Corporation
and get three&#8209;quarter interest in all the patents. Van de Vliet kept the
other quarter, but now they're both hoping to sell off forty&#8209;nine percent
to a big pharmaceutical company. Not American. I can't tell you any more than
that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

job is secure.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yeah, right.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That twitch of nonchalance he had when something really
mattered—even as a child he would attempt (and fail) trying not to gloat over
some personal success. It was moments like this when she realized she'd missed
seeing him and talking to him. When you cut a family member off from you, you
also cut yourself off from them. After all, he was her closest blood kin, even
though he was an unreconstructed shit. At some level she wished she could get
past the bitterness she felt toward him. Could it be he really had changed?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He didn't like the way the scene was going. What the hell was
her problem? He looked at his scotch longingly, then got up and went to the
kitchen and got another ice cube for it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Go easy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>How was he going to get through to her? If word of the Beta
screw&#8209;up got out, the buyout was toast and Grant Hampton along with it.
But if Ally could be brought in . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Grant,&quot; she was saying, &quot;I want to start off
by asking you if you've ever taken a really good look at that guy Karl Van de
Vliet. Does he look anything like his picture? The one that came with that CV
of his.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sure, that's him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And I assume you've actually read his resume?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course.&quot; Here it comes, he thought. The thing
everybody asks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If those dates are right, then he has to be—what?—at
least sixty years old. But in the picture he doesn't look a day over forty&#8209;five.
So what's going on?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ally, you're finally getting it.&quot; He rattled the
ice in his Dewar's, then finally took a deep sip. Maybe, he thought, it would
help with the courage. &quot;He's a truly amazing human being.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's not an answer, Grant. It's a generality.&quot;
She exhaled in obvious exasperation. &quot;But I want an honest answer about
one thing, dammit. Do you actually think he could help Mom's Alzheimer's? Maybe
even reverse it? Tell me the truth. Just once.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ally, I can't guarantee anything. But it's worth a
shot.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now, he thought hopefully, she was sounding like she was
starting to come around. Thank God. As for whether Dr. Vee could cure the old
bird who knew? But he'd overheard the nurses talking about how he and his
research staff had had some phenomenal luck with Alzheimer's. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;By the way, what happened when you talked to Mom?&quot;
he went on. &quot;Did she seem like she understood anything I told her?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Grant, she probably understood a lot more than you
wanted her to. The bad part is, she let you give her some hope. Now, what's
going to happen if she goes out there and ends up being disappointed?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It's a real possibility, he told himself. But it's probably
the only way I'll ever get you out there, and that's what really matters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ally, we'll never know unless ... You should go
too.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Look, maybe I'll talk to Van de Vliet. But it's purely
information&#8209;gathering.&quot; She was staring at him. &quot;So why not
tell me? The whole story. Are you doing this for Mom and me, or are we just
being used like lab animals?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm not sure you're going to believe anything I
say.&quot; He sipped again at his scotch, then walked over to the skylight</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>and looked
up. Finally he turned back. &quot;After Dad . . . and everything, I had trouble
sleeping. I know you didn't think it got to me, but it was like some bad force
had taken over my mind, haunting me. I became obsessed with death. I took off
two months and went to </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Colorado</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, camping. Out there, under the
stars, I did a lot of thinking. Dad had died suddenly, but maybe that was a
blessing in disguise. The rest of us, we all die a little every day. Why does
time do the things to us it does? Why do we have to grow old and
repulsive?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He drew on his scotch again, then continued.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;When I came back, I started doing research on aging.
That's when Karl Van de Vliet's name popped up on the Internet. Some paper he'd
given in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Vienna</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> years ago. It was about the
physiology of aging. But then Tanya came along and I sort of forgot about him.
Then when I went to work for Winston Bartlett, there he was. The very same guy.
It was weird, but it was as though God had delivered him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is this shaggy&#8209;dog story going to end up being
about why he looks so young?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm getting there.&quot; He smiled. &quot;I kept
wondering too, and then finally I saw an opening in his schedule and took him
to dinner here in the city, down at Chanterelle. A social thing. Eventually,
after a couple of bottles of serious wine, it came out that once upon a time he
had done an unconventional experiment. On himself. It was sort of an accident,
something about melanoma research.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So he—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You asked me why he looks so young. Well, some
procedure he did apparently stopped his skin from aging. But then he changed
the subject and wouldn't talk about it anymore. So do I think he's a miracle
worker? I'd say he's walking proof of something. That you can cheat
nature.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There is no 'and.' That's all I know.&quot; He came
back and settled onto the couch. His scotch glass was empty and he yearned for
another, but that small voice inside was urging discretion. This was the moment
that could be make or break.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>      
&quot;But to get back to you, Ally, you really should meet him. I can't talk
specifics about the actual clinical trials, but let me just say they've been
very positive. There's every reason to think he can help you. And Mom
too.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He studied her, trying to read her mind. He wondered if she
could detect the anxiety he felt lurking just beneath the surface. Was she seeing
through him, the way Nina, for all her mental debility, had seemed to?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Grant, has this doctor Van de Vliet gotten into some
kind of medical experiment that's turned into a Faustian bargain? Is his skin
rejuvenation a signal that this research has gone over into The Twilight Zone'!
When a sixty&#8209;something man looks forty&#8209;something, there's got to be
an unnatural act going on. What does it mean?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe it means he's found the thing Ponce de Leon was
looking for. The Fountain of Youth or whatever.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then he'll probably have to pay for it some other
way,&quot; she said getting up. &quot;Mother Nature doesn't give out freebies.
Look, I've got to give Knickers her </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
 color:windowtext'>midnight</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
walk. That's your exit cue. I'll call him tomorrow. I'll go that far.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't blow this chance, Ally,&quot; he said setting
down his empty scotch glass and getting up. He felt hope and it bucked him up.
&quot;It could be the biggest mistake of your life. And Mom's.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was at the door before he turned back. It was time for the
insurance. The hedging of bets. </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
had authorized it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;By the way, I almost forgot. Jesus, I'm going senile
myself. W.B. told me to tell you he'd like you to come over to his place on </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Gramercy</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Park</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
tomorrow morning around ten, if you can work it into your schedule.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What for?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That job on his place that I told you about this
morning, I guess. I do know he's planning to renovate the ground floor. But
just between us, he's also got a massive renovation job in the wings, so maybe
that's what's really on and this is like an audition. Who knows? He bought an
old mansion on upper Park and he's planning to heavily redo it and turn it into
a museum for his incredible collection of Japanese military stuff, swords and
armor and shit. He's going to do over the entire interior. It's part architecture
and part design, so I gave him your name. Who knows? But I was over at his
place this afternoon and he asked about you. He said he wanted to see you as
soon as possible. He even gave me one of his personal cards to give to you.
Here. It has the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Gramercy</span><span

address and his private cell phone.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just like that?&quot; She looked skeptical but took the
card.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Winston Bartlett is not a man who dawdles. If he
decides he wants to do something, he just moves on it. All he asked was that
you bring a portfolio, to show him some of your work.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Winston Bartlett put the newly glazed creme brulee, still
warm from his preparation in the kitchen below stairs, on the bed tray in front
of Kristen, next to her untouched champagne flute. She used to love it and he
was trying everything he knew to jog her memory. He'd cooked her favorite
supper, eggs Florentine, with barely wilted spinach topped by prosciutto, had
taken her to bed and now there was champagne and her favorite dessert.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But she still seemed distracted and distant. Yes, it was a
good idea to get her away from the institute, but that was merely relocating
the problem, not fixing it. If it could be fixed. In the meantime, she had to
be kept here, out of the public eye.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Thank you,&quot; she said and gingerly took a small
bite. She had been almost lucid earlier this evening and was leaning against
the antique headboard wearing a soft blue nightgown. Her long blond hair was
tousled and down over her breasts. Her memory might now be a sometime thing,
but her libido was still going strong.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do you remember how much you used to like that?&quot;
he asked, trying to make eye contact.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She nodded her head dumbly. Did she actually remember?
Increasingly, he had no idea.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He had brought her here to stay in this five&#8209;story
nineteenth&#8209; century mansion on </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
 color:windowtext'>Park Avenue</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.
He'd purchased it a year and a half earlier for 23 million and he was intending
to have it renovated and converted into a museum. That renovation, however, had
been put on hold awaiting a decision by the Board of Directors of the </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Metropolitan</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Museum</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.
He wanted the building to be a </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Park
 Avenue</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> adjunct to the
Met, and he also wanted his definitive assemblage of Japanese implements of war
to be known as the Bartlett Collection.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The tax write&#8209;off would be monumental, but that was not
nearly so important as the prestige.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was clear now that this project would not have any
momentum until he first got himself appointed to the board of the Met.
Unfortunately, money alone wasn't adequate. Major&#8209;league politics was
involved.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was working on it, with a lot of </span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Upper East Side</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> lunches and targeted charity events.
He was also taking his time and getting designs and estimates for the
renovation. The way things were at the moment, he didn't have the cash to
actually start construction anyway.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>For the moment, the place was furnished but unoccupied except
for a security guard, a part of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s
personal staff. Now, with Kristen here, discretion was his uppermost concern.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He had sent the security guy home this evening, so he and
Kristen could have privacy. In the morning two nurses would come on duty, one
to look after her and another to cook.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Over the past year he'd brought her here most weekends. It
was like having their own Shangri&#8209;la. Best of all, unlike his official
residence on </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Gramercy</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Park</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>,
he didn't have a wife upstairs, like some mad (in every sense of the word) aunt
in the attic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He had hoped that bringing Kristen back here might do</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>something
for her memory. He still hoped, but he wasn't sure. In bed tonight she had been
as lithe and enthusiastic as ever. Possibly even more so. Did she know who he
was? He couldn't really tell. But he still loved being with her. The soft skin
and the voluptuous curves of her breasts and thighs: it made him feel young
again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Since she had been out at the Dorian Institute and away from
him, he had begun to feel older and older.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Winston Bartlett was sixty&#8209;seven and—increasingly—felt
it. To begin with, his prostate was enlarging itself, in spite of all the
special, expensive medicines he used Surgery was increasingly looking like a
possibility. And his memory was nowhere near what it once was. He wolfed down
ginkgo and ginseng capsules by the handful but was finding it harder and harder
to remember people's names, particularly the new wave of donation&#8209;hungry
politicians who fawned over him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And then there was the matter of teeth. He'd just gone
through major periodontal surgery, a sign of aging gums. How long before his
ivories would be replaced by ceramic choppers? Oh, and the heart. His
cardiologist was talking more and more about stents to alleviate the two
constricted arteries in the left ventricle. They were already down to 40
percent. Face it, his whole damned body was falling apart.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Probably worst of all, the Johnson was far from what it used
to be; not long back, it was a daily triple threat. Soon he might be resorting
to Viagra as more than a discretionary recreational drug, something he was
still joking about less than a year ago.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The dirty secret about living this long is, after you've seen
everything you ever wanted to see, done everything you ever wanted to do,

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>To try to hang on to it, he had been through clinics as far&#8209;
flung as </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Phoenix</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> and </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Lucerne</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>. He had undergone regimens of antioxidants and injections of
human growth hormone. He'd tried testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone,
better know as DHEA. Maybe it had made a difference, maybe not. Sometimes he
thought he had more libido and energy, but other times he wasn't sure. Maybe it
was just that he'd begun working out even harder, playing handball an extra
half hour every other day. He did know his body was continuing to deteriorate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't want to stay here alone,&quot; Kristen said,
putting down her spoon. &quot;I want to go back to work.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Honey, I can't be here all the time, and you're really
not well enough to go to work. There'll be someone here with you. It's just
till you get better.&quot; He studied her, the face that was so young, and felt
the full weight of the tragedy sinking in. &quot;Do you remember what it was
you used to do?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't remember right now. I mean exactly. I used to
talk to people. I was in this room with lots of bright lights.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She didn't actually remember, he thought. Her former producer
at E!, along with everybody else (including her harridan of a mother,
Katherine), had been told she was at a private health spa in </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New Mexico</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. It had to be kept that way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No one must know she was here. All the phones had been
removed before the ambulance brought her. Starting at six in the morning, there
would be a nurse and a nurse/cook downstairs on a twenty&#8209;four&#8209;hour
basis. Under no conditions could she be allowed to leave, not the way her mind
was now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Kristy, it wasn't supposed to turn out like this. I'm
so sorry. But Karl is doing all he can. We're ... He has a new idea that he's
about to explore. He's going to...&quot; His voice trailed off as he stared at
her unblinking eyes. &quot;You don't remember what happened, do you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But how she looked. My God. The youth. How could a true
miracle have such a tragic downside?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was when the cell phone on the stand beside him chirped.
It was the only phone in the place, and tomorrow it would be gone. No way could
she be allowed to have a phone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The caller ID advised that it was Grant Hampton.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Kristy, I've got a feeling this could take a
while.&quot; He was reaching for his silk robe. &quot;I'll be downstairs on the
first floor if you need anything, okay?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She just stared at him mutely. He shook his head sadly. There
wasn't much time left to mend her. How in God's name had it come to this?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he moved down the spiraling grand staircase, he clicked on
the phone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I was just at he</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
 color:windowtext'>r place</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>,
W.B. I actually got in, which is more than has happened in over four years. I
think she's on board but I'm still not entirely sure. So, just to be safe, I
told her you wanted to see her tomorrow.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Are you saying you couldn't make this happen? With your
own fucking sister?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's ... We're not exactly on the greatest of terms,
Ally and me.&quot; There was an awkward tone in his voice. &quot;It's hard to
explain. Like I told you, I confirmed her blood type on Saturday. It's AB, like
I thought. And I played the mother angle. At the very least, I think she's
willing to drive the old bird out to the institute and meet Karl. That's a
start, at least.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And what about her medical . . . Karl wanted to
see—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm working on it. I remembered something about her.
I've got a guy. He's going to check on it tonight.&quot;</span></p>

growled. &quot;There's no time to screw around on this.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've set it up for you to meet her tomorrow, the way
you wanted. I think she'll show. I told—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The one who really should talk to her is Karl.&quot; </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> sighed. &quot;He knows how to handle
patients.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then he could call her tomorrow. After she's talked to
you. If we all pull together on this, W.B., I'm sure we can get her out there
by day after tomorrow, Tuesday.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The commute from Ally's West Village place to the CitiSpace
office in SoHo was normally a twenty&#8209;minute brisk stroll, and she brought
Knickers with her a lot (the boss's prerogative) since her office was arguably
homier than her home. (Knickers loved to wander around and—she thought—guard
the computers and drafting tables.) This morning, though, Ally had an
appointment for her at Pooch Pros, the dog groomers near her office. A wash and
a trim and plenty of pampering. Betty and Misha always fussed over her
shamelessly, and she gloried in it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But now a pounding rain had just come through, which meant no
walk for either of them. Knickers would show up looking like a bedraggled mop.
Definitely the moment to take the car.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Alexa Hampton liked to say that she wasn't really an auto
person. Hers was a four&#8209;year&#8209;old </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Toyota</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>, light blue, and its modesty befitted her needs. In </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New York</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, hopping around </span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>SoHo</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> and the Village, it made a lot more sense to rely on
a bike or on cabs, or just plain walk. Garaging a car in </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New York</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> cost the equivalent of a studio
apartment rental in most normal places, and the bottom&#8209;line truth was,
she resented the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Toyota</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s presence in her life. But there
were moments when cabs weren't the answer, and this was one of them.
Fortunately, the parking garage she used was just around the corner, so she and
Knickers got there before being totally soaked. Knickers loved riding in the </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Toyota</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, and she always seemed to know what
was coming the minute they turned the corner for the garage. This morning she
gave a gleeful &quot;Woof&quot; and started panting, a sure indicator of joy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As they drove the few blocks downtown, the rain was easing up
but the streets were still shiny. Ally reached into her bag and took out the
personal card of Winston Bartlett. His private residence was on </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Gramercy</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Park</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.
The only reason he could possibly want to meet her there was if he did indeed
have a job. She decided she would call him from the office and confirm the
appointment, assuming he still remembered it. Then she'd get Jennifer to help
her assemble a portfolio of their work and make a color copy to leave with him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She leaned over and rubbed Knickers' ears. Her thoughts were
drifting back to Karl Van de Vliet. At some level his stem cell technology
sounded like the ultimate snake oil. Was she about to take leave of her common
sense to go to see him, or even to consider letting him perform some
experimental procedure on her mother's mind?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>On the other hand, what about him? What kind of
&quot;procedure&quot; could Van de Vliet have done that would stop his own skin
from aging? If Grant had merely told her that Karl Van de Vliet had finally
realized the cosmetician's dream and learned how to make human skin youthful
and supple again, she would have passed it off as just more Wall Street IPO
hyperbole. But seeing was believing, and it also seemed like there was a lot
more going on than just a change in his skin. There was something about him, in
his eyes, that felt . . . inconsistent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was still puzzling on that point when Knickers jumped up
and barked. They were passing a garbage truck and the guys were banging the
cans into the back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Shhh.&quot; She reached to quiet her. &quot;We're
almost there, baby.&quot; Then she tugged at her leash and settled her back
into the seat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Since the rain was all but over, she decided to park the car
where she dropped Knickers off and then walk over to her office, which was only
a couple of blocks east. She found a spot right next to the awning of Pooch
Pros, and the minute Knickers was liberated from the car, she bounded to the
door dragging her leash through the puddles. Misha was already there to meet
her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Come on, my <i>kraceve</i> baby, my beauty.&quot; He
reached down and gave her a big hug. Misha was a gaunt, balding, blond&#8209;haired
Russian who had once been the hero of the Soviet Olympic swim team. Now he
looked like he could stand a piroshki or two to plump him up. &quot;You be big
fluff of cloud after we finishing.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally followed them in, and there was Betty. Ally figured
&quot;Betty&quot; assumed her made&#8209;up but totally American name was
easier than whatever she'd used in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Russia</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>,
but to Ally it just felt weird Betty had dark hair, a broad smile that wouldn't
die, and approximately thirty pounds that would have looked better on Misha.
They reminded her of Jack Sprat, et al.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Honey, there is problem at your office. Woman name
Jennifer call. Say she try reach you at home but you leave already. And you
don't answer your cell phone.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Shit, I turned it off. Knickers goes nuts if it rings
in the car.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jennifer was only a couple of years older than Ally, but
she'd been with the firm back when Ally's father, Arthur, ran it and she was
the mother figure of CitiSpace. She was also Ally's best friend and had been
even before Ally came back to run the firm. Ally felt like she had known her
forever. These days Jen spent a lot of effort trying to create a social life
for Ally that would include eligible men. She kept nagging her to join some
clubs, anything, just get out there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally knew she was right, but she was working too hard to take
time out. She had the idea, which she wasn't naive enough to actually believe
at a rational level, that sooner or later someone who could replace Steve would
come along. Yes, she was lonely a lot, but until this last deterioration of her
heart she'd spent a lot of evenings and weekends outside, biking and hiking
around town, and she knew plenty of people who were interesting and kind. She
sometimes thought her problem was that she liked people, all kinds of people,
as long as they were kept slightly away, at a psychic distance. Maybe it was
the getting close part that never seemed to work out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It had actually been that way ever since Steve disappeared.
She had the premonition that if she got too close to somebody, she was destined
to lose them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now she stood for a second, puzzling. She'd mentioned taking
Knickers to Pooch Pros, so that's how Jen knew where she'd be, but what could
have gone wrong at </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>7:45</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> in the morning?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jennifer wasn't usually in this early, but she was finishing
a rush job for a marble bathroom for a couple on the </span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Upper East Side</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. On days when Jennifer did get to
the office first, she'd have the coffee going and an extra bagel for Knickers,
on the chance Ally might bring her, which she often did. But to phone Betty
just to tell her to hurry? That was odd.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Should I call now?&quot; It seemed pointless. She was
no more than ten minutes away. What else could go wrong in ten minutes?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She sound very hurry,&quot; Betty declared.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally took her cell phone out of her bag and switched it on.
The office rang only once and then Jennifer was there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ally, you're not going to believe who called here ten
minutes ago, asking for you. Winston Bartlett. My God, it's like Donald Trump
called. Well, actually it was some male secretary or something. He said he was
calling to confirm your </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>ten
 o'clock</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> appointment. At
an address on Gramercy Park East. What's that about? Jesus, Ally, where are
you? I don't know what you're up to, but this could be big. He owns entire
buildings, for chrissake.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Did you say I was coming?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I didn't know what to say. He left a number to call if
you can't make it. Otherwise, he'll assume you'll be there. It's only two hours
from now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All right, Jen, let's put together a 'folio’ of our
biggest jobs. Lead with that gut rehab we did on the building down by the South
Street Seaport. And put in those two floor&#8209;through lofts we did on that
conversion in TriBeCa. The ones with the slate bathrooms and the stainless&#8209;steel
countertops in the kitchen.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've already started. Do you know specifically what he
has in mind?&quot; She paused. &quot;How did he find out about us,
anyway?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My creepy kid brother works for him.&quot; She sighed.
&quot;It’s a long story. Be there in a couple of minutes.&quot; She clicked off
the phone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Betty, thanks a lot. I've gotta run.&quot; She turned
and gave Knickers a last rumple of the ears. &quot;Be good, baby. I'll pick you
up by six at the latest.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What wrong?&quot; Misha was concerned, twisting a white
towel he was holding. &quot;Big problem?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nothing's wrong. Actually, something probably is wrong.
I just don't know what it is yet.&quot; She headed out the door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The design firm her father had started and she'd kept going,
now with some architecture thrown in, was on the ground floor of an old industrial
loft building whose upper floors had been converted into rental apartments in
the early 1980s. The owner was an ex&#8209;wrestler named Oskar Jacobi, who had
turned Zen master (after a fashion) and had a studio upstairs, on the second
floor. He had drifted from wrestling into karate during his thirties and thence
into the life of the mind, or rather the life of &quot;no&#8209;mind,&quot; in
his late forties. Now he taught meditation as well as karate and insisted they
be learned in that order. He served as his own superintendent, mopping the
halls and setting out the garbage on pickup days.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The ground floor was zoned commercial, and CitiSpace had a
lease for all of it, which meant she had tons of space. Oskar had given Ally's
dad, Arthur, a ten&#8209;year lease, which was now a fraction of the going
rate. They both knew that, and she'd more than once offered to renegotiate or
move, but he said he didn't need any more income and, besides, he liked having
her as a tenant because she reminded him of her father. It was a generosity perfectly
in keeping with his philosophy that excess money corrupted the spirit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She'd done the place as a sort of Spanish desert flower, with
burnt&#8209;orange tile floors and all the natural materials she could cram in.
A lot of her clients wanted the hard&#8209;edge industrial look in their lofts,
which was fine by her, but she found it too cold for a daily working
environment. The front was unassuming, with small lettering on the window.
CitiSpace was not a walk&#8209;in business. And she had no metal gates over the
windows. What's to protect?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When she marched through the door, everybody looked up from
their coffee and computers, and Jennifer led the applause. Winston Bartlett.
Had they finally made the A&#8209;list? This could be the start of something
big.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally stepped out of the cab, holding the large leather&#8209;bound
portfolio, and checked the number on the card against the bronze plaque above
the door. Winston Bartlett lived like a nineteenth&#8209;century robber baron.
The building had five stories and was adorned with Italian marble window
lintels that glowed like mother&#8209;of&#8209;pearl.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Already she liked his sense of style. </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> was New Money, but this place had
the solemn dignity of Old Money. The front door was eight feet tall and solid
mahogany. The odd thing was, there were two doorbells. One read w.<span

 color:windowtext;text-transform:uppercase'>e. bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext;text-transform:uppercase'>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was when she remembered she had read somewhere that he
had a wife named Eileen. But why did she have a separate doorbell? Winston
Bartlett had a tabloid reputation as a womanizer. Perhaps they lived apart. If
so, there it was, for all the world to see.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She found herself examining the late Greek Revival columns on
either side of the door. They were marble and meticulously cleaned of soot,
whose ubiquitous presence in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New
  York</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> meant that
eventually everything not regularly scrubbed turned gray. It told her that
Winston Bartlett liked things to be immaculate and that he was a stickler when
it came to details.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She glanced up and noticed that she was being observed by a
security camera. She was reaching out to push the bell for w.<span

  color:windowtext;text-transform:uppercase'>bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> when the door magically opened. A
tall, trim Japanese man in a crisp black suit was standing in the doorway. But
he had a muscular build that would be more appropriate for a bodyguard than a
butler.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hello,&quot; she said. &quot;I have an appointment
with—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes.&quot; He nodded, appearing to know exactly who she
was. &quot;He's upstairs in the library. Please . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She'd expected a grand central staircase in the Palladian
design, but instead there were elevators off to the left of the entryway. But
even without an obvious staircase, the ground floor and its fifteen&#8209;foot
ceiling were palatial in every sense of the term. The marble floors were
covered with antique, and expensive, Persian rugs, and the light tan wallpaper
was flecked with gold leaf, giving the feeling it could have been meticulously
stripped from some palazzo in Venice. The lighting fixtures were a row of
chandeliers down the middle of the vast room, and at the back was a dining
table that appeared to be large enough to seat thirty dinner guests. The
architecture was a showpiece for the extravagant taste of some Victorian
&quot;enemy of the people.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But what really set it apart was that the walls were lined
with exquisitely severe antique swords and armor from </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Japan</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. In a way, the room felt like the foyer of a boutique
museum, an adjunct of the Asia Society.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Japanese man directed her to one of the elevators, and
then got in with her. She still couldn't decide whether he was a butler or a
bodyguard. He had the polished demeanor of the first, but the strapping body
and deft movements of the latter. Maybe he was both. In any case, he looked
like he would be quite at ease brandishing one of those long samurai swords.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The elevator had dark paneling and smelled of freshness,
partly fresh wood and partly fresh lacquer. It was utterly silent as it glided
up to the third floor. When the door opened, she stepped into what appeared to
be a large den/library, except that there was a huge four&#8209;poster antique
bed at the far corner, with its drapes drawn around the side. It was definitely
something out of anothe</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>r
 place</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> and time. Was
this </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s bedroom? The space was
magisterial.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In the other corner was a wide mahogany desk covered with
phones and papers and two computers. From his photos, she recognized the man
rising to greet her as Winston Bartlett. Seeing him in the flesh, she first
noticed that there was something in his eyes that in another man might be
called ruthless, but in him it merely came off as determined. They were eyes
that were accustomed to getting what they wanted—be it a company, a building, a
woman.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Fine, Ken, and please have them hold my calls,&quot; </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> said nodding to the Japanese man,
who tipped his head in acknowledgment and disappeared back into the elevator.
Then he turned to her and extended his hand. &quot;Ms. Hampton, I appreciate
your making time for me. I'm possibly your newest fan. After Grant told me
about you, I had a couple of my people do some research. You've been
responsible for some very interesting, even elegant interiors. Grant may have
told you I have a big project down the road that you might wish to bid on. But
for now, as a way of getting to know each other, I wanted to talk to you about
a more modest undertaking.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She thanked him, attempting to take it all in. She was trying
not to admit to herself that Winston Bartlett was an attractive man, in the way
that power brings charisma. &quot;I'd be happy to hear about what you have in
mind. I don't necessarily take every job that comes along. I always look for
challenges.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She listened to herself and wondered why she was starting off
the meeting in such a confrontational manner. Probably, she thought, it was
because she didn't want to seem intimidated. Doing high&#8209;end interior
design, you come across a lot of wealth and power, but this was a whole new
level.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, I guess I'm the same way.&quot; He smiled.
&quot;A lot of the things I've done over the years have ended up being a
challenge. And a risk. But now and then, something is worth it.&quot; He
gestured toward a couch. &quot;Please, we have a lot to talk about.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He returned to the chair behind his desk and turned off the
laptop computer he had been using.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I brought a portfolio,&quot; she began, &quot;with
photos. There's also a DVD with virtual walk&#8209;throughs of some of our
projects. I'm not sure what you have in mind, but this should give you some
idea of the kind of thing we—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll look at it,&quot; he said, setting the portfolio
aside unopened. &quot;I'm sure you live up to your reputation. Like I said, I
have two jobs pending, so first let me outline the smaller one. This building
was built just before the prior turn of the century, and it was intended to
house a small workforce of cooks and nannies and seamstresses below stairs. The
rooms were lit with town gas, and coal was used for heating and cooking. Then
in the twenties, everything was gradually switched over to electricity and oil
and natural gas. But very little effort was made to accommodate the change
aesthetically. It was just retrofitted.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's typically how it was done.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And I haven't really cared until now,&quot; he went on.
&quot;But lately I've decided I want to redo this place properly. Starting
below stairs and moving up. It's mainly the kitchen down there that concerns me
now. I want to remove all the outdated fixtures and go state of the art.
There's nothing original there anymore; just somebody's idea of a
'modernization' back in the fifties. So nothing of historic value will be lost.
I don't want a restaurant kitchen precisely, but I want a range with enough
Btu's that it could be. Granite countertops are all the rage these days. . .
.&quot; He paused, then grinned sheepishly. &quot;I promise I won't start
telling you how to do your job. Work up some ideas without any interference
from me, and then we'll see where we go from there.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do you have any blueprints of this building? The
original plans?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He smiled, as though to say you ask good questions. &quot;As
a matter of fact, they were filed downtown, in a little&#8209;known cranny of
the Department of Buildings and I had an expediter I know track them
down.&quot; He paused. &quot;Ms. Hampton, there is one little matter I want to
clear with you in advance. I know that the newspapers occasionally print things
about me that might be termed unsavory. You came to meet me here, so that tells
me something about your feelings toward me. But I have discovered that I am a
somewhat controversial figure in certain circles. I'd just like to know if you
think of me as controversial.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She found this unexpected new tack in the conversation
puzzling. Was he trying to get a rise out of her?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I barely know you, Mr. Bartlett,&quot; she said.
&quot;And, frankly, the private life of a client is none of my business. So
that question is entirely unnecessary.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Very well.&quot; He smiled. &quot;Like I said, there's
a much larger job now in the planning stage. I have a building on </span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Park Avenue</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> in the Seventies that I'm planning
to convert into a museum. It would be a private undertaking at first, but in
the long run, who knows? The job will require extensive alterations of the
building, and I also plan to have a museum cafe in the lower level. Anyway,
there's a lot of work ahead, and I thought this would be a good way for us to
get acquainted. Redoing the first floor here would give us both some idea of
whether we could work together on a larger project.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She listened and found herself wondering what he was really
up to. This conversation felt like he thought he needed to have plenty of bait
on the hook.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>First Grant and then him, a tycoon who's a perfect stranger.
Why?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Winston Bartlett was not finding himself entirely satisfied
with the way things were going. As he looked her over, he had a lot on his
mind. This was the woman who shared his rare blood type and could represent his
last hope. So far, she seemed smart and courageous. Given the gravity of what
he'd heard about her heart condition from Karl—which you'd never realize by
just looking at her—she had to be courageous to continue on with her kind of
spirit. But that was not necessarily all to the good. She might not be so easy
to manipulate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Inevitably he found himself comparing her to Kristen. For
starters, Alexa Hampton seemed to have a lot more self&#8209; assurance. Kristy
liked to appear tough on camera, but she was riddled with an aspiring actress's
insecurities. Which had played a large part in the current tragedy. But you
could say she brought that on herself. Alexa Hampton was struggling with
something she had nothing to do with. And to look at her, you'd never know it.
That was spunk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In truth, this was the kind of woman he'd often wished he'd
married—someone who shared his own gusto for life. God had dealt her a
particularly lousy hand, and yet she still had drive. She had more courage in
her little finger than that monster upstairs, Eileen. And the fact was, she was
more appealing than Kristen. But don't even think about going there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Coincidentally,&quot; he said, beginning a new tack,
&quot;there's a totally unrelated matter I wanted to discuss with you. I
understand Grant has already told you about the clinical trials currently
winding up at the Dorian Institute, which is part of one of my companies. He
told me about your heart condition and about your mother's Alzheimer's. We're
working on a new procedure that could be very relevant for both of you. The
clinical trials are scheduled to conclude in just a few days from now, but I
spoke with the lead researcher there, Dr. Van de Vliet, and he said there's
still time to get you into the program.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, Grant came to see me and brought me a
brochure.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your brother is very concerned about you and your
mother, and he specifically asked me to inquire if you had any questions about
the procedure that I might be able to answer for you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was watching her carefully, all the while trying to keep
his tone casual.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, I think my mother is interested. Quite frankly,
she doesn't have much to lose, though she may be in denial about that. In my
own case, I'm not so sure. I still don't know anything about Karl Van de
Vliet.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She's still toying with the bait, </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> thought. I can't yank the line just
yet, but she’s close. She’s so close.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Truly, the best thing you could do would be to talk to
him,&quot; </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> said getting up from his desk and
walking over to the window and pulling the curtains aside. The mid&#8209;morning
light streamed in, a momentarily blinding presence. I've got to shake this up,
he told himself. &quot;As a matter of fact, I'd like for you to meet with Karl
before we go any further with this job. We need to get you well first. And your
mother. He's had some truly amazing successes with both Alzheimer's and
Parkinson's.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's just that this is all so experimental. Aren't
there any side effects? New drugs or new medical procedures always have side
effects.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, he thought, now you've hit on it. But that part is best
left to Karl.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If you have questions, that's all the more reason to
check out the clinic,&quot; he declared. Time to close the sale. He came back
and sat down behind the mahogany desk. &quot;I've seen a lot of medical innovation
over the years, including a good bit in my own companies. But there's never
been anything that remotely compares to the promise of stem cell technology.
And these stage&#8209;three clinical trials have shown how many miracles are in
the realm of the doable.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Grant said Dr. Van de Vliet wanted to include someone
with my specific condition in the—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let me be frank with you.&quot; He looked across at her
and smiled. &quot;You would be a perfect fit. But the trials are going to be
over very, very soon, so he's anxious to get started.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Truthfully, I'm thinking about taking Mom out
there,&quot; she said. &quot;And since we're all being so frank, let me say I'm
getting the impression that my going out to your clinic is really the reason
you wanted to see me today. It's—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's the second reason,&quot; he said. &quot;The design
job is uppermost in my mind, but I see nothing wrong with having two purposes
in seeing you. As someone once said, commerce is the mutually beneficial
exchange of worth.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Was she agreeing to see Van de Vliet? Playing the mother card
may have done the trick.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, why don't we stick to tangible worth,&quot; she
said. &quot;Let me take a look at the space downstairs. But you'll have to tell
me some more about what you have in mind.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I propose we do it the other way around. You go down
and look around, take measurements, make sketches, whatever it is you do, and
then get back to me with some ideas. That'll be our starting point.&quot; He
picked up a walkie&#8209;talkie on his desk and punched a button. &quot;Ken,
could you please come up. I'd like you to show Ms. Hampton the service
floor.&quot; He clicked it off without waiting for a reply. &quot;I'm due down
at the office. When I get there, I'll have them cut a check for five thousand
dollars as a retainer and messenger it over to your shop.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Is this going to work? he wondered. Maybe I should be pushing
harder. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He examined Alexa Hampton one last time as he rose to leave.
Yes, she's a rare woman. Wouldn't it be ironic if Karl actually could do
something for her heart?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Ally watched Winston Bartlett sweep from the room, she was
still trying to take measure of the man. What troubled her was why Grant and
Bartlett were both so anxious to get her and her mother out to the clinic. But
give </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> his due. He could charm the birds
off the trees.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She looked around the room, wondering what the old kitchen
and staff quarters would be like. Certainly not like this. The library/bedroom
had a rich, over&#8209;the&#8209;top feeling, with a beautifully molded plaster
ceiling, a virtual bas&#8209;relief of fruits and birds and clouds all
meticulously painted. It wasn't the Sistine Chapel but had some of that
feeling. The paneling and wainscot were burnished mahogany, and the floor was a
mix of hardwoods worked into an isometric design. She decided it was probably
the most luxurious private residence she had ever seen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>CitiSpace was mainly known for its creative handling of lofts
in the abandoned commercial buildings of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
 color:windowtext'>SoHo</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
and TriBeCa. These old mansions of the nineteenth&#8209;century moguls were an
entirely different world. It was intimidating, but she was sure she could do
something below stairs that would retain the period flavor of the building
while creating the kind of semiprofessional space he said he wanted. Still, it
was different from anything else CitiSpace had ever done, so he had no way of
knowing whether or not she could pull it off. Again that question: why on earth
would he hand her this plum job?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And where was his wife? Although he liked to be photographed
with blond starlets, the tabloids always reminded you that he had a wife
someplace. The two doorbells were a tip&#8209;off that that someplace was here.
Best guess: she probably had the top floors.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My God was Madame Bartlett going to get involved in the
renovation? A lot of women with superrich husbands and too much time on their
hands come to assume that that happenstance creates in them a natural gift for
interior design. Big problem.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But whatever happened, this could be a sweetheart job. And
maybe she'd get a crack at that museum he'd talked about. That was the kind of
thing an architect&#8209;turned&#8209;interior&#8209; designer dreamed about.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She looked up to see the Japanese man—</span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> had called him Ken—stepping into the
room. He was all business.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

he stepped into his limo to head downtown.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She said she's thinking about bringing her mother out
to the institute, Karl. I believe she's ready to do it. Before she changes her
mind, I want you to talk to her and schedule an appointment for tomorrow
morning, if you can.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll put in a call to her office.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Karl, she's not there now. Try her cell. Grant has the
number. We need to get moving on this. I've done about all I can at the
moment.&quot; He was watching the midmorning traffic that was clogging the
avenue. He always felt claustrophobic in a limo, even a stretch. The only time
he felt free was when he was in the McDonnell Douglas chopper. When he was
flying the chopper, against all the laws of civil aviation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't you think that's a little pushy, W.B.? We
shouldn't seem too anxious. Believe me, I've had a lot of experience with
ambivalent patients.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All right. She should be back at her office sometime
after lunch.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll wait awhile and put in a call there.&quot; He
paused. &quot;When was the last time you saw . . .  Beta One? The situation at </span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Park Avenue</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't want to discuss it over a cell, Karl.&quot;
This conversation was definitely a bad idea. &quot;She comes and goes. I think
it's getting worse.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll try to get over there late this afternoon and look
in on her,&quot; Van de Vliet said. &quot;I want to see her every day.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Karl, we can't give up hope. Never give up hope.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He clicked off the phone and thought about his crapshoot with
God. Kristen had wanted to play, to experiment with the Beta. But nobody made
her undergo the procedure. She should never—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>His cell phone rang.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mr. Bartlett,&quot; came a female voice with a </span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Brooklyn</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> accent, &quot;it's Bernd Allen
calling.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Put him on.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Shit, </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> thought, this is news I don't want
to hear.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Bernd was a Brit who was in charge of day&#8209;to&#8209;day
accounting for Bartlett Medical Devices. He was forty&#8209;seven and not a
risk taker and he was always worried about something. That was his job. These
days he had plenty to be worried about</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He had been running a weekly projection of the cash flow at
BMD, and the drawdown was now getting perilous.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The flagship product of Bartlett Medical Devices had been the
&quot;balloons&quot; used in heart angioplasty that inflate and expand clogged
arteries. They were marketed together with stents, miniature metal mesh
supports that keep coronary arteries open after angioplasty. The problem was
that in 27 percent of the cases, the stents manufactured by BMD caused scar
tissue to form, a process called restenosis, and re&#8209;block an artery,
requiring a repeat of angioplasty or even a bypass operation. Other
manufacturers' numbers were not any better. But a few months back, out of the
blue, Hemotronics, a competing company near </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Boston</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>,
had introduced stents coated with drugs that prevented scarring. BMD's piece of
the $2.6 billion angioplasty market had plummeted from 13 percent to 4 percent
and was still dropping like a stone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Add to that, two titanium joint replacements for arthritis
patients that they'd pinned their future on—along with millions in cash—still
had at least two years of human trials left before</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>they could
hope for FDA approval. Long story short, BMD was in a mature product cycle with
its most lucrative hospital hardware, with nothing major in the pipeline for at
least two years. They had bet the ranch on the stem cell research at Gerex.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;W.B., I just got last week's numbers back from the
green&#8209; eyeshade chaps downstairs. As you asked, I had them refine all the
assumptions. Remember the union contract. There's going to be a three percent
wage increase for all hourly personnel at the end of the month. And we didn't
hedge our Euro exposure and now it's going against us. That's my own bloody
fault. And since we don't have any pricing flexibility in that territory at the
moment it's like a four percent haircut right off the bottom line. Remember we
ran that in a worst&#8209;case scenario a while back. Well, chances are we're
about to see it for real.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
had been watching the rate of cash burn and trying not to let the problem be
evident. The logical thing to do, start laying off workers in the fabrication
divisions, was out of the question. If you had a make&#8209;or&#8209;break deal
cooking, you couldn't afford to look like you were on the ropes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Give me some parameters,&quot; </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know we've already hit our credit lines at Chase
about as hard as we dare without them calling for a review. So unless we try to
refinance some real property, say the flagship building downtown—and in this
interest&#8209;rate environment any rational lender would put a gun to our
head—we've got to ink this deal with Cambridge Pharmaceuticals in two months
max. Right now we're living on borrowed money and it's about to be borrowed
time too.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>You don't know the half of it, </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'> thought. I'm already living on borrowed time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What's more, if word of the Beta gets out, we can kiss the
buyout <i>adios</i>. The adverse publicity and legal problems ... Nobody's
going to buy into that kind of liability. Not </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Cambridge</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>, not anybody. Bernd doesn't know about it yet. If he did,
then he'd really be worried.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Bernd, take a deep breath. We're on schedule and we've
got to make sure we stay that way. Get hold of Grant and tell</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>him I want
him to double&#8209;check the regulatory situation for the </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Cambridge</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> deal. I know he already has, but I
want a memo from our attorneys by </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
 color:windowtext'>noon</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
tomorrow. If there are going to be any roadblocks cropping up, we need to know
about them now. We can't afford to be blindsided.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He clicked off the phone and tried to think. In the confines
of a limousine, it was hard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What's it all for?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Unknown to the world—but, unfortunately, known to his wife,
Eileen—Winston Bartlett had a natural son. And that son, now in his own career,
despised </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. It was one of many sorrows he had
long since learned to bear.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>All the same, he increasingly regretted that he had made such
a botch of their relationship. The man who was his natural son had done very
well for himself professionally, had plenty of drive. And in fact </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> believed he himself deserved some of
the credit for that. What he had done was let the boy fend for himself, which
was exactly how </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> was raised. Make it with your own
two hands. How else are you supposed to develop any character?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And it had worked. The pity was, he now hated Winston
Bartlett's guts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> had begun thinking more and more
about a legacy. What if he could make peace with that son and bring him into
the business? Right now the closest thing he had to a son was Grant Hampton,
and </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Hampton</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> was a little too slick and
expedient. </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> knew a gold&#8209;standard hustler
when he saw one.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The more he thought about it, the more he was convincing
himself to make his natural son his sole heir.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Assuming there was anything left to pass on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Monday,

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>11:20

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mr. Bartlett asked me to give you this,&quot; Kenji
Noda said handing her a large manila envelope as they stepped off the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>elevator.
&quot;It's a copy of the original plans. And also, there's a blueprint for the
current layout, along with measurements.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She took it, looking him over again as she did. There was
something very fluid about his motions. He could have been a dancer. There was
a softness about him, and yet you got an unmistakable sense of inner strength.
She suspected he had something to do with </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s
incredible collection of Japanese <i>katana</i>. He looked like he could have a
connoisseur's eye.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She walked into the below&#8209;stairs service space and
looked around. The back part, which was the kitchen, had stone walls that had
been whitewashed. There also were two massive fireplaces, which, she assumed,
had once housed coal&#8209;burning stoves. Large grease&#8209;and&#8209;soot&#8209;covered
gas ranges were there now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But the space was fabulous. Massive load&#8209;bearing
columns went down the center, and a partition separated the front half of the
space from the back. The front traditionally would have been the nursery and
sewing room, in short, the maids' working quarters.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She turned to the man </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
had called Ken.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Does Mr. Bartlett have a cook?&quot; she asked.
&quot;This kitchen doesn't look used.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No,&quot; he said. &quot;Actually, he almost never
dines here, and Mrs. Bartlett has her meals delivered from various restaurants.
Though she does go out sometimes as well.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This was the first time she had heard any mention of Eileen
Bartlett.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She resides on the top two floors,&quot; he went on.
&quot;She has her own dining room up there, where she takes her meals, along
with an efficiency kitchen.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartletts</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> did live completely separate lives.
That explained a lot.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay,&quot; she said, &quot;I want to look around and
get a feeling for the space and start putting together some ideas.&quot; She
was starting to focus on the job. The ceiling was lower than upstairs, but
still the space had enormous possibilities. &quot;Off the top, I'd probably
suggest we open this out. Remove that dividing wall and make a great room. With
the right kind of kitchen, this could be a marvelous contemporary space for
semiformal dining and entertaining.&quot; Assuming, she thought, Winston
Bartlett actually wanted a renovated space to entertain. She still had the
nagging suspicion that he just wanted her. &quot;I'd use materials that have a
really warm tone.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mix different materials for the different parts of the
kitchen and the room, she thought. The cabinets could be mahogany, to echo the
extensive use of that wood upstairs, and the walls around the stove area and
the fireplaces could be an earth&#8209; colored slate. And that look could be
accented with polished granite countertops in a slightly darker hue. There
would need to be a high&#8209;Btu stove, probably a big Viking, with a slate
backsplash all around. A couple of stainless&#8209;steel Sub&#8209; Zero
refrigerators and a large Bosch dishwasher could be spaced along in the slate
and granite. And if </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> wanted it, there could be a place
for a temperature&#8209;controlled wine cellar. High&#8209;end design.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There also would need to be a large stone island—say a Brandy
Craig—with a couple of sinks and—depending on what he wanted—maybe another high
Btu stovetop there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She turned to Ken. &quot;If you have something else to do . .
. I just need to walk around and live in this space a little. Then I want to
make some notes on the plans. Possibly take a few photos.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Take your time,&quot; he said. &quot;I'll be
upstairs.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He disappeared into the elevator, with his curious catlike
gait, and was gone in an instant.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As she looked around she realized the thing that was missing
was light.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Wait a minute, she thought, there must be a garden at the
rear of this building. There are windows in the front, so why aren't there any
at the back?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She turned to examine the back wall. It was, in fact, clearly
of recent origin, and there was a door at one side. She walked over to the
door, which was locked with a thumb latch, and opened it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And sure enough, behind the building was an unkempt space the
width of the building that ran back for a good thirty or thirty&#8209;five feet.
When she stepped out into the late&#8209;morning sunshine and looked at the
back of the building, she realized there also was a row of windows facing the
garden that had been bricked shut. What a travesty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The whole design would depend on whether those windows could
be reopened. But if </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> would allow it, then there were
tremendous possibilities. With all this light, you could—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who the hell are you?&quot; came a raspy, oversmoked
voice from behind her. &quot;Are you his new tart? We agreed he would never
bring his whores here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally turned to see a tall, willowy woman, who appeared to be
in her mid&#8209;sixties. She had shoulder&#8209;length blond hair, clearly out
of a bottle, and a layer of pancake makeup that looked as though it had been
applied by a mortician.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Perhaps it would be helpful if I introduced
myself.&quot; She squeezed past the woman in the doorway and walked over to the
counter, where she had left her bag. She extracted a business card and
presented it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The woman squinted at it, obviously having trouble making out
the print.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I work with the design firm CitiSpace, and I was asked
by Mr. Bartlett to give him an estimate for some renovations.&quot;  She had
quickly acquired the sense that the less said to this woman, the better.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm his wife and I still don't know who the hell you
are.&quot; She squinted at Ally a moment, then glanced back at the card.
&quot;What is . . . CitiSpace?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's an interior&#8209;design firm.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What are you, then? Some kind of decorator?&quot; She
grasped the door to steady herself and Ally suddenly wondered if she was
slightly tipsy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Actually, what we do is probably closer to
architecture.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally was collecting her belongings, hoping to get out before
Eileen Bartlett decided to do something crazy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This is the first I've heard about all this.&quot; She
turned and slammed the rear door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mind if I ask you a question?&quot; Ally said. &quot;Do
you have any idea why those back windows were bricked over?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's for security,&quot; she said. &quot;No one is ever
down here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That's obvious, Ally thought, which is why this job is so
odd. This space clearly isn't being used now, and the social dynamic here
doesn't bode well for a lot of cozy entertaining and dinner parties in the
foreseeable future. So why is he spending money to renovate? And in this big
hurry? And he just happened to pick me to do this as an audition for designing
an entire museum. No, this whole thing definitely does not compute.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But of course it does. The job is a blatant bribe. To butter
me up for something.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Look, Miss Whoever&#8209;you&#8209;are, I want you to
leave. I don't appreciate strange women walking around unescorted in my
house.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm going right now. Perhaps you should speak to Mr.
Bartlett and decide together what you want to do about this space.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll tell you right now what I want to do. Nothing. For
all I know, he's fixing <b>this</b> up so he can move in some tart. We've lived
here for twenty&#8209;eight years and he's never done anything down here. So
why is that tightfisted SOB suddenly deciding to renovate?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That would be an excellent question to ask him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're screwing him, aren't you?&quot; she demanded,
wrinkled brow furrowed and dim eyes seething. &quot;Like that other little
whore of his. That's why he hired you. Well, let me tell you something. I'll
outlive you both.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Without another word she turned and got into the elevator.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, how did it go?&quot; Jennifer asked the minute
Ally came in the door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She wasn't sure she knew the answer to that. Initially the
job looked like a lot of fun, but now she felt the interpersonal dynamics of
working in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s home were already a problem even
before she started.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Also, maybe it was just paranoia, but as she took the cab
downtown from the mansion on </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Gramercy</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Park</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>,
she got the impression that somebody was following her in a black SUV. And the
stress of that brought on a tightness in her chest. But as she neared their
office in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>SoHo</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, the vehicle abruptly veered east.
She had a nitro tab at the ready, but she didn't have to pop it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There's good news and bad news. The good news is he's
practically handing us a sweetheart of a job, and dangling another—designing a
whole museum—in our face. The bad news is, I don't know why he suddenly thinks
we're so terrific. I mean, you and I know that but how did he figure it
out?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jennifer looked puzzled. &quot;You mean he—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Oh, did I mention that his crazy wife showed up after
he left and essentially accused me of being a hooker? I suppose that comes
under the heading of bad news.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Great. Does that mean she's going to start second&#8209;guessing
whatever we do?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The communication channels between Mr. Bartlett and
Mrs. Bartlett don't appear to be all that great. They live on different floors
in his place—which really is a huge old mansion on </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Gramercy</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Park</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>,
by the way—and the job would be in his part, the lower level.&quot; She
explained the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartletts</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>' living arrangements. &quot;He wants
to redo the garden&#8209;level floor. It was originally the servants' quarters.
Like Upstairs, Downstairs.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So he's upstairs and she's way upstairs.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And let's hope she stays there.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally fetched herself a cup of coffee, checked in with
everybody to see how they were doing, and then settled herself at her computer.
She had the latest program in computer&#8209;aided design (CAD) and she wanted
to program in the dimensions and layout of the space. And since she had a copy
of the blueprints, the first thing she would do would be to run them through
her flatbed scanner and incorporate them into the program. She didn't get a
chance to take any digital photos with CitiSpace's snazzy (and expensive) new
Nikon. But if the job went forward there'd be plenty of time later.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Everybody's computers were connected to the Net via a
broadband DSL hookup and they were never turned off. Because of that, the
computers were vulnerable to being hacked so Jen had installed a firewall
program to keep out snoops.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She sat down and stared at the screen saver, which was an
ever&#8209;changing series of tropical beaches at sunset. She sipped at her
coffee—this was the one cup she allowed herself each day, always saved for the
moment when she felt she needed to be most alert—and reached to turn on the
scanner. The tightness in her chest that she had momentarily experienced in the
cab had completely disappeared and she felt perfectly normal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What was she going to do about her mother and the clinic in </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New Jersey</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>? Nina certainly appeared to want to
go. And with the inevitability of what lay in store for someone with early&#8209;onset
Alzheimer's, taking her out there was surely worth doing. But as for her own
heart, she wasn't so sure she thought the reward was worth the risk. But she'd
decided to hold off on a decision till she could have a firsthand look at the
institute.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She took another sip of coffee and then tapped the keyboard.
When she did that, the screen would normally bring up the &quot;desktop.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But not this time. A file was open, and she was certain she
hadn't left it open. What's this?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Jen, could you come here a minute? There's something
funny.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The first page of the file that had been pulled up and opened
was an ID photo of herself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This is what was running. Has somebody been fooling
around with this computer?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jennifer looked puzzled when she saw it &quot;Not that I know
of.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then how did this get . . . ?” She just sat staring.
&quot;I didn't open this file. Does this thing have a mind of its own?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>About eight years ago, Kate Gillis at Manhattan
Properties—with whom Ally had an occasional after&#8209;work drink— told her
she'd scanned all her vital personal documents into her computer at home. She'd
said it was an easy way to make a safety backup.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Seemed like a good idea, so Ally had stored a copy of her
birth certificate, her driver's license, all her credit cards, her passport, a
set of medical records, even the mortgage on her apartment. She'd even scanned
in an ID photo, just for the heck of it. She also suggested to Grant that he do
the same.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Brilliant right? Well, maybe not.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The reason was, she'd routinely made an updated copy on a ZIP
disk and then copied it onto this computer here in the office. Like a second
backup.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I had everything ready for you for your meeting with </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, so nobody here has touched your
computer this morning.&quot; Jennifer furrowed her brow. &quot;Could somebody
have picked the locks and come in last night and done this, like a prank or
something?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Come on. That's totally far&#8209;fetched.&quot; She
was trying to imagine how somebody could have gotten in and out and left no
trace. Impossible. &quot;This must just be something stupid I did when I came
down yesterday after seeing Mom. I don't remember it, but I guess I was pretty
tired.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've never seen you that tired.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jen's right, she thought. I was on the city's Web site
checking the Department of Buildings' Housing Code, but I certainly didn't pull
up my personal data. Computers do strange things, but to open a data file for
no reason? That would require a higher intelligence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Right?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Jen, you're our resident computer expert. We leave
these things hooked up all the time. I know we have a firewall, but what are
the chances that somebody could defeat it somehow and hack into our
computers?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jennifer was a software whiz and she had all the designs for
all the clients on their CAD system, which they used to create a virtual&#8209;reality
space and allow clients to &quot;walk&quot; through.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, that's entirely possible. Our firewall software
is over a year old. Let me take a look. Maybe I can reverse&#8209;engineer what
happened. If somebody went through pulling up files, I might be able to figure
it out.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally relinquished her chair and stood staring as Jennifer
started checking the firewall.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was scary to think that some stranger could know everything
about you. But on the other hand what difference could it make? She had nothing
to hide. Still, it was creepy. Her Social Security and credit card information
was in that file. Could that be—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Shit. Ally, you're not going to believe this. Whoever
did this was damned good. We've been seriously hacked.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How do you know?&quot; She bent over to look.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Our firewall software has been disabled. In fact, the
actual program was uninstalled. Jesus, that's cool. I think we'd better shut
down everybody's Internet connection right this minute, till we can get some
new software.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's incredible. You mean somebody—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Honey, hackers have gotten into Microsoft's own site.
Even the Pentagon, so I've heard. Anything is possible.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This is not good.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What are you thinking?&quot; Jen was still staring at
the screen and tapping at the keyboard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm thinking what a jerk I was. I keep all my personal
information in that file, like a safety backup in case my apartment burned down
or something. Scanned it in. My passport, driver's license, credit cards,
medical records, everything.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jennifer looked puzzled. &quot;You can just cancel the credit
cards. As for the rest of the stuff, what could anybody possibly want with
it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't know, Jen. I don't even know if we were hacked
by somebody who wants to find out about me, or just look at our designs.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was reflecting that when somebody goes through your
files, they want the information for a purpose. And that purpose couldn't be
positive for you, or they wouldn't have started their undertaking with a
surreptitious act.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, I'm going to check around and download a new
firewall program. Right now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Shit, I don't need this. I've got enough on my mind
already. Mom wants to go out to a clinic in the wilds of northern </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New Jersey</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> and see a doctor there. And the
whole thing makes me nervous.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Oh Jesus, is the place called the Dorian Institute by
any chance?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How did—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm such a scatterbrain. I took a message for you while
you were gone. From a Dr. Van de Something. I think that's the name of the
place he's with. He wants you to call him back as soon as possible.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Monday,
April 6 </span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>11:43 <span
 style='text-transform:uppercase'>a</span>.m.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Would she call back? Karl Van de Vliet had to believe she
would but nothing in this world was sure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>On the nineteen&#8209;inch screen of his office IBM, he was
scrolling the medical file that he'd downloaded earlier that morning. How Grant
Hampton got his hands on it, he didn't know and didn't want to know.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Yes, Alexa Hampton would be perfect. She had aortic valve
stenosis, well along, the same condition that had precipitated the coronary
destruction that took Camille from him. It was the great tragedy of his life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He studied the charts carefully, trying to assure himself he
was making the right choice. What if the stem cell procedure on her heart
didn't work? To fail would mean he couldn't have saved Camille after all. That
was actually the main reason he'd kept putting it off. He didn't want to know
if he couldn't have rescued her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But Alexa Hampton was the obvious candidate. Her clinical
condition had deteriorated to the point that, at some level, you might even say
she had nothing to lose by undergoing an experimental procedure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And she was perfect in another way as well. Other than her
heart condition, which she could do nothing about, she was in excellent physical
shape. Her last blood pressure was 110 over 80 and her pulse was 67. She
clearly had been exercising, which had been both good and bad for her heart,
though on balance probably a plus. In fact, it was indicative of a strong
fighting spirit, which was often the best prognosticator of all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He looked up to see Dr. Debra Connolly walking in. He had
just paged her. She was an M.D. who had been his personal research assistant
during her grad school days at Stanford. Now she was a full and valued member of
the research team. Just turned thirty, she also was a smashing blonde, five&#8209;nine,
with a figure that would stop traffic, even in her white lab smock. She held
Van de Vliet in the reverence always bestowed on a brilliant, beloved mentor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hi, Deb, I wanted you to take a look at this.&quot; He
indicated the screen. She knew all about the Beta and what had happened to
Kristen, the Syndrome, but she didn't know about the plan to subject Alexa
Hampton to two procedures at once: one for her aortic valve stenosis and
another to develop antibodies to combat the looming side effects of the Beta in
Winston Bartlett.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This is the patient I was telling you about. I wanted
you to see this. Let's pray she signs on for the trials, because she looks like
she could be perfect, in a lot of ways.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But if she doesn't call back, he told himself, what am I
going to do?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What am I looking at?&quot; Debra asked, scrolling the
page. &quot;Is this what I think it is?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's her medical history.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How did you get it?&quot; She turned back. &quot;Did
she send it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, Deb, and I don't think you really want to
know.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Somehow, I think I probably should.&quot; She looked
again at the screen. &quot;We're in this together.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All I know is, I got an e&#8209;mail from Grant
Hampton, and this was an attachment. She must have been keeping it on a
computer somewhere. I understand he's her brother, but how he got it, I have no
idea. He said we're not supposed to let her know we have it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How recent—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This final battery of tests is less than two weeks
old,&quot; he said, pointing to the date on the corner of the page. Then he
scrolled.         &quot;Take a look at her high&#8209;speed CT scan. See that
degenerative calcification there. Now look at the same test last year.&quot; He
scrolled past a number of pages. &quot;See.&quot; He tapped the screen, then
scrolled back to the first image. &quot;Over the past year there's been a
significant buildup. She's made&#8209;to&#8209; order for the clinical
trials.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And there was another reason he wanted her, which he was
reluctant to admit to himself. There was a photo of Alexa Hampton in her
medical files and something about her reminded him of Camille. Her eyes had a
lot of spirit. They made you want to root for her. It was nothing short of
ironic that this woman had the exact same medical condition that took the life
of Camille, who had been at his side during the early stages of the research
that now might provide a cure. But for Camille it had come too late. It was
more than ironic; it was heartbreaking. Now, though, to save Alexa Hampton
would be a kind of circular recompense. He took a last look, then closed the
file.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Does she want to be in the clinical trials? There's not
much time left. We'd have to get her—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I just left a message at her office,&quot; he said
revolving around in his chair. &quot;Grant has talked to her, and so has W.B.
This very morning. She's aware that time is of the essence. But there's no
guarantee she'll do it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He glanced at his mute phone. If she didn't call back today,
he had a feeling that Winston Bartlett might just have her seized and brought
to the institute by force.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I see that her blood type is AB,&quot; Debra said.
&quot;Extremely rare.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Funny she should notice, he thought. Is she going to put it
together?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's the same as </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s
blood type,&quot; she continued. &quot;Interesting coincidence, huh?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Right.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're already fond of her, aren't you?&quot; Deb asked
finally. He detected the usual tinge of rivalry seeping into her voice.
&quot;Without even meeting her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Dear God, he thought, don't start that. It's the same with</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>every
attractive female patient under the age of fifty. I don't have time for games
now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The truth was, Karl Van de Vliet was turned on by Debra
Connolly. What red&#8209;blooded primate wouldn't be? But she was half his age
and to act on that attraction would be to guarantee trouble. He had enough to
worry about without a lab romance. Besides, he was still thinking about
Camille. They'd had the kind of long&#8209;lasting, thick&#8209;and&#8209;thin
love Debra would never understand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>However, she did sufficiently understand the problems with
the Beta procedure and the Syndrome, so he had to flirt back. She had to be
kept on the reservation. Feign an interest but not enough for it to go
anywhere.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Deb, she's just an ideal fit for the study, that's all.
Nothing more.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The stem cell procedure for her stenosis should go forward
with only minimal risk. There was every reason to hope he could rejuvenate the
tissue in Alexa's left ventricle. It was merely an extrapolation of the kind of
heart procedure that had worked such a wonder for Emma Rosen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The real challenge was simultaneously attempting the Beta&#8209;
related procedure. The trick was to stimulate the development of antibodies
through a moderate dosage of the special Beta enzyme, tempering it enough that
it didn't go critical and begin replicating uncontrollably, the way it had in
Kristen, and (probably) very soon in W.B. Not so low as to be inoperative but
not so high that it would go out of control. The &quot;Goldilocks dosage,&quot;
not too much, not too little. The problem was, he wasn't absolutely sure what
that dosage was.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Should he tell Alexa Hampton the full story about what he was
doing? About the Beta? That ethical question, he had decided, he would leave to
Grant Hampton, </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s hustler of a CFO. It was his
sister, after all. Presumably, he'd tell her whatever she needed to know to
make an informed decision. Let the responsibility be on his head.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The phone on his desk finally rang.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Stone Aimes was floating through cyberspace, through the
massive data pages of the National Institutes of Health. Since the Gerex
Corporation had a complete clampdown on their clinical&#8209;trial results, he
was attempting an end run. By going to the source, he was hoping he could find
out whether or not Karl Van de Vliet's experiments with stem cell technology
were succeeding.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He needed that information to finish his book, and he hoped
that the remainder of the advance could be used to pay for his daughter Amy's
private school in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New
  York</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, if he got it in
time. He was dreaming of a life in which she could come back to live with him
at least part of the year. Sometimes, particularly days like this—Monday was
his official day off—he couldn't avoid the fact he was incredibly lonely.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But first things first He had gone to the section that
described the many and varied clinical trials the NIH had under way. Then he
used &quot;scrambled eggs,&quot; the entry protocol given to him by Dale
Coverton, to circumvent security on the site and get him into the second&#8209;level
NIH data files. He was hoping to find the names of patients who had gone
through the Gerex stem cell procedure and could be interviewed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It really wasn't all that difficult, or even—he told
himself—unethical to get in this far. No big deal. Entry protocols were
available to any high&#8209;level NIH employee who had the right security
grade. Now he was poking through the reams of proprietary data that the Gerex
Corporation had submitted to initiate the clinical trials.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was one of the more ambitious studies he'd ever seen, not
in numbers of patients necessarily but certainly in scope. They were indeed
running stage&#8209;three clinical trials of their stem cell procedure on a
variety of maladies. There was no double&#8209;blind placebo. You either were
cured or you were not.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jesus, it was incredible. They were shooting for nothing less
than the unified field theory of medicine, aiming not just to patch some
failing element of the human body but to regenerate entire organs. Among their
stated objectives were building pancreatic islets, reconstructing the
ventricles of the heart, reconstituting the damaged livers of individuals with
advanced cirrhosis. They were also accepting patients with Alzheimer's and
Parkinson's.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Christ,&quot; he said, scrolling past page after page,
&quot;how come they're suddenly so secretive about this?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>If Van de Vliet had achieved results in just a fraction of
those trials, it would herald the beginning of a new age in medicine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The NIH monitor for the Gerex trials was Cheryl Gates, just
as Dale had said. Her photo was featured along with the introductory
description of the trials. Nice&#8209;looking, he thought, probably late
thirties, dark hair, dark&#8209;rimmed glasses. She wasn't wearing much makeup
in the photo, probably to emphasize how serious she was. Sooner or later, he
told himself, he had to find a way to meet her. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He stared at his IBM Aptiva screen a moment longer,
overwhelmed at what he was seeing, then got up and walked into the kitchen and
made a peanut butter sandwich, whole wheat. It was a rehearsal for the possibly
hard times to come. Then he retrieved a Brooklyn Lager from the fridge. It was
his day off and the sun was over the yardarm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He lived on the fourth floor of a brownstone in Yorkville, in
</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New York</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s East Eighties. The apartment was
small, but it was rent stabilized which meant he was paying well under market
value—$1,128 a month on a place that probably could go for close to twice that
on the open market. He'd lucked into it after he and Jane split—even though
they weren't married they'd bought a condo in the West Fifties, and at the
breakup they'd switched the mortgage to her name—but the problem now was, how
was he going to pay even this piddling rent (not to mention child support for
Amy) after he got fired from the Sentinel? That day, he sensed was fast
approaching. And if it happened before the book was finished he was just three
months away from going back to freelancing. That was how long his &quot;nest
egg&quot; would last.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Carrying the sandwich and beer, he walked back to his
&quot;office,&quot; a corner of the cramped living room that had an Early
American desk, and sat down at the frayed chair in front of his IBM.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So here he was, past the first level of security of the NIH
site, zeroed in on the Gerex clinical trials. Somewhere here had to be all the
data about the patients who had been, and currently were, participating.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He moved on to the results section and opened the first page.
Yes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he looked more closely.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hello, we've got a problem. The patient data he was looking
at had only code numbers for names. The categories of trials also were just
numbers. Without a key, there was no way to get a single patient name or
differentiate Alzheimer's from fallen arches. Then he saw the notice at the top
of the page: As part of the NIH policy on privacy, all patient data are
aggregated and anonymous.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Shit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This was as far as &quot;scrambled eggs&quot; would take him.
He needed a higher security protocol to get into individual&#8209;case data.
Dale either didn't have it or didn't dare give it out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, he thought, at least I've got information on the
structure of the clinical trials. I should print that before the system
realizes it's been hacked. He clicked on the print icon. Let the games begin.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>His real objective was to try to wangle an interview with
Karl Van de Vliet, an interview that would have to be approved by Winston
Bartlett. Maybe what could be gleaned from this level of the NIH site would be
enough to bluff </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> into thinking he knew more than he
really did. In truth, interviewing discharged patients would have meant
anecdotal information, probably not rigorous enough for use in a definitive
book. But at the moment, that would have been a start.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He lifted the first printed page and studied it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Stone Aimes had seen enough clinical trials over the years to
know that the data were reported according to an established schedule.
Obviously, the schedule was always adapted to fit the nature of the trials
under way, but studies that produce the kind of short&#8209;term results Gerex
hinted at in their early press releases—before they clammed up—would probably
have a tight reporting schedule, possibly even weekly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He stared at the page for a moment, then lifted out another.
He wasn't sure just yet what it all meant, but he might be able to infer
something. He was still puzzling over the columns of numbers as the data
finished printing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What was it telling him?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He went back and clicked on<span style='text-transform:uppercase'>
study procedures</span>. This section explained how the reporting was
structured. He still held out hope that the names of the discharged patients in
the clinical trials could be accessed somehow. In the past, when the FDA tested
drugs, it often happened that the names of the participants were not revealed
to the monitor, or to anybody. The policy was intended to preserve the privacy
of study participants. But lately it had been under review. All that secrecy and
non&#8209;accountability had permitted some spectacular fabrication of test
data.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Surely the NIH had taken this into consideration by now and
come up with a system whereby the identities of the participants could be
checked and verified. That information had to be stored somewhere.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No such luck. It appeared the NIH had begun using a modified
version of the new FDA sunshine policy. NIH clinical trials had a &quot;one
week of sunshine&quot; provision, during which the suitability of test subjects
could be evaluated by a review procedure. During that time, their real identity
was in the database. But after that, the identity information of any patient
actually selected for inclusion in the clinical trials was encoded—where
thenceforth it could only be accessed through a lengthy legal process.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Screwed again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At this late date, the Gerex Corporation surely was not going
to be adding any new names and giving them that week of sunshine. According to
press releases at the beginning of the clinical trials, when Gerex was a lot
more communicative, at this date the entire study should be just days away from
being wrapped up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He went back to the patient files one last time, out of
frustration. As he continued to scroll, he noticed that although the identities
of patients and crucial personal data were encrypted, the dates on which they
entered and finished the trials were all supplied.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hmmm. It was actually more detailed than that. There were
dates for when a patient entered each stage of the procedure: Screening,
Initial Evaluation, Admitted into Program, Procedure Under Way, Procedure
Monitoring, Results Evaluation, Patient Release, Patient Follow&#8209;up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The time between screening and patient release averaged
around five weeks, six weeks at most</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Looking at the time&#8209;sequenced data, you couldn't avoid
the conclusion that the clinical trials had been a spectacular success. No
doubt the specific data would reveal whether there had been any adverse
reactions, but as clinical trials go, these seemed to have been without major
incident. He had a nose for trouble, and these looked as rigorous as clockwork.
. . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hold on a second. . . . <i>That’s</i> odd.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What the data structure did not have was a category for
Termination. Yet one of the patients had been listed with dates leading up to
and including Procedure Under Way, but after that the patient was noted
parenthetically as having been &quot;terminated.&quot; That was all the
information given.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What could that mean?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He leaned back with a sigh and pulled on his Brooklyn Lager.
Okay, patients frequently got dropped from clinical trials because some
underlying condition suddenly manifested itself and made them unsuitable trial
subjects. In fact, that was preferable to keeping them in a study when they
were no longer appropriate. But the thing about clinical trials was, there
always had to be a compelling, fully explained reason for terminating a test
subject. Otherwise you could just &quot;terminate&quot; non&#8209;responsive
participants and skew the results. No reason was given here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He thought again about the &quot;one week of sunshine,&quot; and
as a long shot checked to see if anyone had been admitted this week.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nada, but again that was reasonable. The entire study was
wrapping up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Which meant, in short, that he had nothing to work with in
terms of people. All he had were dates and encrypted names.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What now?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He finished the beer and was preparing to go off&#8209;line
when a drop&#8209;down screen flickered<span style='text-transform:uppercase'>
new data.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was being directed to the new applicants'
&quot;sunshine&quot; page.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He clicked back, then stared at the screen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A name had appeared.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He couldn't believe his luck. For some unknown reason,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>they must
still be adding new test subjects at this late date in the trials.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext;text-transform:uppercase'>nina hampton.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Finally he had a name. This was an incredible stroke of...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Wait. A second name was appearing now, the letters popping up
one by one as they were being typed in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He rolled the mouse to print, and felt his hopes surge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then his heart skipped a beat. The second name was . . . <span
style='text-transform:uppercase'>alexa </span></span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext;text-transform:uppercase'>hampton</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext;text-transform:uppercase'>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jesus, could it be?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No way. Too big a coincidence. But wait, the other was Nina
Hampton. Isn't that the name of her Brit mum? That unredeemable piece of work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Impossible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>If it was the Ally Hampton he knew, she was a woman he still
thought of every day. It went back to when they were both undergraduates. She
was taking a degree in architecture at </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Columbia</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
and he had just switched from premed to the Columbia School of Journalism.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Wasn't there a Cole Porter lyric about an affair being too
hot not to cool down? They undoubtedly were in love, but they both were too
strong&#8209;willed to cede an inch of personal turf. It was a combustible
situation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When they decided to go their own way, it was done under the
agreement that they would make a clean break and never see each other again. Be
adult and hold your head high and look to the future. No recriminations and no
second thoughts. In respecting that agreement, he had gone out of his way not
to keep track of her. He particularly didn't want to know if she'd gotten
married had a family, any of it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Thinking back now, he remembered that she had had some kind
of heart condition. She refused to talk about it, and now he couldn't remember
exactly what it was. But that could possibly explain her entry into the
clinical trials, though it didn't clarify why she was only being added now, at
the last minute.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>If it was actually her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And if so, how would he feel talking to her? He hoped time
had mellowed her, though he somehow doubted it. Not Ally.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What an irony. If it was the same Alexa Hampton, she could
end up being his entree into the secretive world of Winston Bartlett's Gerex
Corporation. The trouble was, he wasn't sure he actually wanted to see her
again. Even after all the years, the wounds still felt fresh.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He closed out the NIH file and opened People Search, which he
often used to look up phone numbers. He started with </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New York</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>State</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
as a criterion. The names Alexa and Nina undoubtedly belonged to women, so they
might be listed merely by their initials. But start with Alexa and be
optimistic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He got lucky. Three names and phone numbers popped up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>One was in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Manhattan</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, and Ally was a dyed&#8209;in&#8209;the&#8209;wool
New Yorker, but he wasn't sure he was psychologically prepared to speak to her.
That number he decided to save for last, though it was by far the most
plausible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The next Alexa Hampton lived in </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Syracuse</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, with area code 315. He was still
shook up as he dialed the number.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yeah, who's this?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Sure didn't sound like Ally. But he was playing this
straight. As a reporter he always started a conversation by identifying
himself, so naturally he answered, &quot;Stone Aimes, New York Sentinel.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The fuck you want?&quot; came the voice. It was female
but it definitely was not ladylike. &quot;I don't need any newspapers.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Whoa, that definitely didn't sound like Ally. She was direct
but she didn't talk like a sailor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sorry, ma'am. I have a few questions about your
participation in some clinical trials. Sorry to bother you, but I have a
deadline. Shouldn't take a minute.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You a fucking reporter?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm doing a story on the Gerex Corporation. Are
you—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The what corporation? The fuck you talking about?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Seems like I'm calling the wrong number. I'm very sorry
and I apologize.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Listen, if you're some kind of weirdo, I'm going to
call the cops and have this call traced.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I said I apologize.&quot; He hung up and thought about
another beer. This was beginning to feel like the moment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But he resisted the urge and called the next number. Come on.
Be the right one and don't be Ally.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This one had a 516 area code. That meant </span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Long Island</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hello,&quot; came a rusty old voice that had to be in
its seventies. It sounded oversmoked and just hanging on. Again definitely not
the Ally he knew.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hello, ma'am,&quot; he said &quot;I'm sorry to bother
you, but—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Are you trying to sell me something, young man,&quot;
the woman asked. &quot;It's not going to do you much good. I live on a Social
Security check, and it's all I can do to make ends meet as is. You sound nice,
but—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, ma'am, I'm a newspaper reporter. I'm doing a story
on ... I just wanted to follow up on your admission to the clinical trials for
the Gerex Corporation.&quot; He felt a surge of hope. It wasn't Ally, but she
did sound like a woman who might well be a candidate for medical treatment.
&quot;Do you know what day you plan to start?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What on earth are you talking about?&quot; she asked.
&quot;Young man, it's ill manners to start asking a body silly questions, no
matter how nice you might be otherwise. I've never heard of this, whatever you
called it, corporation.&quot; Click.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She sure didn't sound like a patient. Or maybe she was too
far gone to even know if she was a patient or not. In any case, this was not a
promising lead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Okay, he thought, go with the one you should have in the
first place.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Blast. He wanted this to be the one, but he just didn't want
it to be Ally. Or maybe he did.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He took a deep breath and punched in the last number, which
had a </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Manhattan</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> area code, 212. The phone at the
other end rang five times and then an answering machine came on. At this hour,
she would most likely be at work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hello, this is Alexa Hampton. I'm sorry I can't come to
the phone now, but if you'll leave your name and number, I'll get back to you
as soon as possible. If you're calling about design work, the number of
CitiSpace is 212&#8209;555&#8209;8597.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He felt his heart flip, then sink. It was Ally. It was a
voice he had heard for years in his reveries—or were they the nightmares of
roads not taken?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She still might not be the new patient in the clinical
trials, but at least he knew he could reach her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The sound of her voice. After all this time he didn't realize
it would still affect him the way it did.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So, he thought, clearing his head, she's running a design
business now. He wondered how that had happened. The last time he saw her, she
was a single&#8209;minded student of architecture. Intensely focused.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No message. Don't leave a message. It probably would freak
her out. Actually, it might freak them both out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Assuming she was the new patient, how the hell did Ally get
involved with Winston Bartlett? It probably would have something to do with
that heart condition she didn't like to talk about.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He clicked off the phone and settled it onto the desk. Then
he glanced again at the computer screen and decided to go back to the NIH
files. The other woman, Nina, he would look up later. Ally's Brit mum must be
getting on by now, but still it was hard to imagine anything being wrong with
her; as he remembered Nina, the woman was well nigh indestructible</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When he got back to the NIH Web site and went to the
&quot;sunshine&quot; page, it was again blank. The two new names, Nina Hampton
and Alexa Hampton, were not there anymore. They must have been entered immediately
into the clinical trials. But why now? If Van de Vliet kept to the original
schedule, the trials would be over in a matter of days.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Maybe, he thought, this was a momentary screw&#8209;up. I
just happened to be at the right place at the right fleeting moment, when
somebody, somewhere, was entering those names. Maybe some NIH bureaucrat hit
the wrong key on a keyboard someplace in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Maryland</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But it was the break he'd been waiting for.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He turned off the IBM and headed for the fridge and another
Brooklyn Lager. Ally, Ally, Ally. Can it be you? This is so weird.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Worse than that, it was painful. There was that immortal line
from </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Casablanca</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>: &quot;Of all the gin joints in
all... she walks into mine.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Why you, dear God?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Coming back, he sat down, took a long hit on the icy bottle,
and reached for the phone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As she hung up, Ally wondered again what she was getting
into. But she did want to meet this miracle worker. The kind of thing Van de
Vliet was talking about sounded as much like science fiction as anything she’d
ever heard. Still, his voice was reassuring, even mesmerizing, and there seemed
no reason not to at least check out the Dorian Institute firsthand. But then
what? Help!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She looked at her coffee cup and wished she dared have a
refill. But that much caffeine always made her heart start to act up. And maybe
she didn't need it. The conversation with Karl Van de Vliet had energized her
and sharpened her senses quite enough.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was still thinking about that when the phone rang again.
There was an electronic voice directory, but her own phone was the default if a
caller did not care to use it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;CitiSpace.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hi, Ally. Tell me if you recognize the voice. Just
please don't hang up.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Who was it? The intonations were bouncing around somewhere in
the back of her brain, as though they were a computer file looking for a match.
The one her unconscious mind was making was being rejected by her conscious
mind. Then finally the match came through and stuck.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My God, it couldn't be. The last time she’d talked to him
was   ... what? Almost two decades ago.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The irony was, she’d been thinking about him some lately, as
part of taking stock of her life. She’d been meditating over all the roads not
taken, and he’d been the last man she’d actually loved or thought she loved
before Steve.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What . . . How did . . . ?&quot; She found she was at a
loss for words. She figured he’d have been the same way if she’d called him out
of the blue.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, this isn't easy for me either. But I have a pretty
good reason for breaking our vow of silence.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was immediately flooded with mixed emotions. Stone Aimes.
She already knew he wrote for the Sentinel. Or at least she assumed the
irreverent reporter by that name who did their medical column was him. The tone
sounded so much like the way she remembered him. There was a lot of passion and
he was always editorializing against &quot;Big Medicine.&quot; He had plenty of
raw courage, but sometimes he had too much edge. That was one quality he had that
had eventually gotten to be nerve&#8209;racking back when they were together.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now, in hindsight, she remembered their breakup with both
anger and regret. She was angry that, even though she tried like hell, she
could never really connect with him at the level she yearned for. He always
seemed to be holding something back, some secret he was afraid to divulge.
Truthfully, they both were grand masters at never allowing vulnerability. In
short, they were overly alike. They shared the same flaws.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Still, after Steve was taken away, it was hard not to think
of Stone now and then. Before Steve, Stone was the only sane lover she'd ever
been close to.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But she also knew the bit about letting sleeping dogs lie.
Sometimes that was the better part of wisdom. This conversation, she finally
decided, was just going to open old wounds. Better to nip it right now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And add to that, she didn't actually know if he was free now
or not or what</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But he'd said he had a good reason for calling—what could
that be?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Stone, I read your columns in the Sentinel. So I sort
of feel like I've kept in contact. I can almost hear your voice
sometimes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That makes me think you were cheating a little on our
deal.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well,&quot; she heard herself say, &quot;some of them
were pretty good. Sometimes you sounded like you knew as much as a
doctor.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't flatter me excessively, or I might want to start
believing you.&quot; He laughed. &quot;But speaking of doctors, didn't you used
to have some kind of heart issue? How is that these days?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You really want to know?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe it might have something to do with why I'm
calling. Best I recall, you never actually told me, even back when.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Thank you for asking,&quot; she said. &quot;I guess
it's not much of a secret anymore, with me popping nitro every other day. I
have a scarred valve, coronary stenosis, and it's not getting any better. I
don't know what to do about it short of going to </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Lourdes</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'> for a miracle.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I see,&quot; he said. Then he fell silent. Mercifully,
he didn't come up with false bravado about revolutionary treatments and you
never can tell, blah, blah, blah. Then he said, &quot;So is that why you've
enrolled in the clinical trials at the Dorian Institute? To be part of their
work using stem cells?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What! &quot;How the hell do you know about—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, Ally, you know I can't divulge my sources. After I
knew you, I grew up to be a real reporter. That was my grand plan,
remember?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then this may turn out to be a very short conversation.
I have nothing to—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, okay, let's start over.&quot; He paused and
cleared his throat. &quot;Ahem. Are you the Alexa Hampton who was formally
entered about half an hour ago into the stage&#8209;three clinical trials for
the National Institutes of Health being held by the Gerex Corporation? Or maybe
I should play dumb and begin by asking if you've ever heard of them.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Stone, why . . . why are you asking me this?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was bizarre. How could he know? And wait a minute, what
did he mean about enrolling? She hadn't enrolled in anything.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ally, I'm finishing a major—I hope—book about stem cell
technology, and right now the world leader is the Gerex Corporation. I think,
but I can't yet prove, that their Dorian Institute out in </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New Jersey</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> is the site of some pretty
incredible stuff. I was ... fooling around on the Internet, on the NIH Web
site, looking for information about them, and—it must have been some momentary
computer glitch—someone with your name popped up for a second. Along with a
Nina Hampton. Which made me suspect it was you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was incredulous. She was being entered into the clinical
trials before she had even seen the place? Somebody was pushing the pace.
Winston Bartlett or Van de Vliet had taken it for granted that she and her
mother would enter the trials. Worst of all, it took a former lover she hadn't
talked to in x&#8209;zillion years to give her this unnerving information.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Nina is your mom, right?&quot; he went on. &quot;I
still remember her fondly. I don't think she thought much of me, however. By
the way, how is she?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She's . . . she's not doing all that great.&quot; Ally
was still trying to get her mind around what she'd just heard. &quot;But why
are you calling me, Stone?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If anything I've said rings a vague bell, then could we
meet someplace and talk? I don't think it would be a great idea to do it over
the phone. That's all I really can say now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Maybe, she thought, Stone Aimes might have uncovered a few
things of which she ought to be aware. His pieces in the Sentinel showed he was
a damned good reporter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't think what little I know about Gerex would be
any help to you.&quot; She was attempting to get her mind back together.
&quot;I actually have a lot of questions about the stem cell procedure myself.
I spoke on the phone just now with Dr. Van de Vliet and he described their
technology to me in general terms. But maybe I should interview you. Maybe you
could explain it to me using that wonderful gift you have for simplification in
your columns.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ally, I don't know anything except what's in the public
domain. They're privately held, so they don't have to tell anybody zilch. I
assume you've actually been out to the Dorian Institute, which is more than I
can say.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Never.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But you're enrolled—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm not enrolled in anything.&quot; To say the least.
&quot;And it bothers me that anybody thinks so. But I am thinking about taking
Mom out there tomorrow, if she still wants to go. When I talked to him on the
phone, Dr. Van de Vliet wanted me to start the procedure immediately. That's
scary, but he does seem to know what he's doing.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I take it, then, that you're leaning toward going
through with it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She hated the way he'd just made her sound so gullible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The truth is, I'm more concerned for Mom. He claims he
can help her early&#8209;onset Alzheimer's, and that would mean a lot.&quot;
Why was she telling him all this stuff? She found herself wondering if he'd
ever married.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm so sorry to hear that. But the chances are he
can.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What are you thinking?&quot; she asked finally.
&quot;And why did you call me? Really? What's going on?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't know yet. There's a lot I don't know.&quot; He
seemed to hesitate. &quot;Ally, is there any chance whatsoever that—while
you're out there—you could get me the names of some of the</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>people
who've been through the clinical trials? The Dorian Institute is entirely off&#8209;limits
to the press. I tried several times to schedule an interview with Karl Van de
Vliet, the guy you talked to, but no luck. I can't get past the corporate
people. My only hope is to try and find some patients who've been treated and
released who've completed the clinical trials. But Gerex has been ruthless
about keeping their identities secret You are literally the first person I've
found who has any connection with the institute and is willing to talk about
it. That is, <i>if</i> you're willing.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Stone, it would be like the blind leading the blind. I
don't know the first thing about the place.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, let me ask you this—when you were talking with
him, did Van de Vliet happen to mention any occasion where a subject had been
terminated from the trials?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It never came up. Why do you—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Never mind. But when and if you go out there, you might
inquire about that.&quot; He paused. &quot;Don't get me wrong. I'm actually
Gerex's biggest fan. I mean, considering merely what you told me, that they're
claiming to have a procedure that treats early&#8209;onset Alzheimer's. Think
about it. I'm rooting for your mom, sure, but that's a Nobel Prize in itself,
right there. We're talking major medical history in the making.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And I want to publish the first book about it.&quot; He
paused. &quot;Also, a little birdie tells me that something not entirely kosher
may be going on out there. No proof, just a reporter's hunch. There's a little
too much sudden secrecy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally was having a strange feeling come over her. She was
actually enjoying talking to him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Shit, Stone, I'm glad you called. I lost two men I
loved very much since I knew you and I'm feeling very alone at the moment. I
could use some moral support I've got a lot of people bugging me to enter those
clinical trials. Even people I'd never met before, like Winston Bartlett, the </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New York</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> big shot. He's suddenly very
concerned about my health. I have no idea what that's about. But it makes me
uneasy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There was an awkward lull, then, &quot;Ally, all I'm asking
is that you just take the measure of the Dorian Institute when you're out there
and tell me what you think about the place. Are they performing the miracles
they announced as their objective?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Look, I'll help you when and if I actually can. So give
me your number, okay?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He did.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I can tell when I'm being blown off,&quot; he went on.
&quot;I have a very sensitive blow&#8209;off detector. But why don't you try a
test? When you're out at the institute, ask Van de Vliet or somebody why that
mystery patient was terminated from the clinical trials. See if the question
makes them uncomfortable.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why does that matter so much to you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If a patient is dropped for no good reason about the
same time they clamp down on information, I think it could be fishy. Beyond
that, I cannot speculate. And while you're at it, I'd love the names of some
other ex&#8209;patients. Anybody. I found a list on the NIH Web site but
they're all encoded, so it doesn't do me any good. I just want to ask them if
the procedure worked or not. It's information that's going to be made public
eventually, no matter what. Come on, Ally, don't you want some
testimonials?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, look, I'll try to see if anybody there will give
me any info.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was realizing she was in a comfort zone when she was
talking to him. Still, so much about him remained a mystery. He had always said
his mother and father were both dead, but it was still suspiciously hard to get
him to speak about them. She'd gotten the impression that he didn't actually
remember his father. That was the part of his life that he'd always been the
most closed off about. Either that or he was repressing some horrible memories.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Thanks a lot, Ally.&quot; A pause, then,
&quot;Interested in getting together sometime?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let me think about it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She put down the phone with her mind in turmoil. She realized
she hadn't asked him if he was &quot;attached&quot; but the next time they
spoke, she was going to try to ease it into the conversation.</span></p>

  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s </span><span style='font-size:

 color:windowtext'> </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Park</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> project and scan them into their CAD
program. After all the phone calls yesterday, she'd been too sidetracked to do
it. Although </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> had declared he wasn't in any hurry,
he had messengered a certified check to her office Monday afternoon. The project
was a go. She wanted to get moving while everything was fresh in her mind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Before leaving her apartment this morning, she'd downloaded a
map from MapQuest and from it she had estimated that the drive up to the Dorian
Institute would be approximately an hour—give or take. She had begun the trip
early because her mother's mind had been lucid the previous evening and she was
hoping that interlude might last into this morning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Unfortunately, it had not.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nina was sitting next to her now, in full makeup but
completely unresponsive, seemingly in another world. When Ally arrived at the </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Riverside Drive</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> apartment to pick her up, Maria—now
silent and uneasy in the backseat, reading a Spanish novel—met her at the door
with a troubled look and shook her head sadly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Miss Hampton, I know she was all right when you were
here last night, but this morning ... she may not recognize you. She'll most
likely snap out of it and be okay later on, but right now she's just in a fog.
It was all I could do to get her ready.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When Ally walked in, Nina was sitting in her favorite chair,
dressed in her favorite black suit. Her makeup was perfect Thank you, Maria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, sweetie, you look great.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nina stared at her as though trying to place the face and
said nothing. She just looked confused and very, very sad.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Dear God, Ally thought, this is the first time she's
completely failed to recognize me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was so disheartening. Last night, when Ally had come up to
discuss whether or not she still wanted to explore Dr. Van de Vliet's experimental
treatment, Nina had been completely cognizant. Ally had tried to explain the
concept of neural tissue regeneration using stem cells, which was difficult
since she barely understood it herself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mom,&quot; she had said &quot;this might be something
that could reverse some of the damage to your... memory. At least keep it from
getting worse. I know it sounds scary but everybody says the conventional
treatments for what you have don't work very well or very long.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then let's go out there and talk to him, honey. Just
come in the morning and take me. By then I'll probably forget everything you've
said tonight.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>How prescient, Ally thought sadly. Now Nina was just gazing
blankly ahead, silent. Does she remember anything from last night?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>For that matter, what was Nina thinking now? Was she
conscious of the fact she was losing her mind? And what</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>about the
ultimate question: do we want to live longer merely to be alive, or do we want
to stay alive in order to do things? To be or to do? In her mother's case, she
knew it was the latter. Nina had always been full of life, ambition, and
projects. Would she want to go on living if none of those things were possible?
You never know for sure about other people, even your own mother, but Ally
suspected she would rather not live to see that day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now, though, was she even aware it was coming?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally thought back about the first signs. Nina hadn't yet
turned sixty&#8209;five when she abruptly started having trouble remembering
little things. She began forgetting where she'd put items, and she gave up on
remembering phone numbers and dates. Initially it had just seemed like a lot of
&quot;senior moments&quot; run together, very puzzling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But then it got worse. She'd always loved music, and she'd
always played the piano. She loved Chopin, especially the nocturnes. By the
time she was sixty&#8209;six, however, she was having trouble remembering the
names of her favorite composers. She also completely gave up trying to play,
either from memory or with the music. When getting dressed one day, she put on
her blouse completely backwards. It was bad.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally had taken her to see four different specialists and they
all had concluded that Nina Hampton suffered from what was known as familial
early&#8209;onset Alzheimer's. It was caused by a mutated gene and was
extremely rare, representing only some 5 percent of all Alzheimer's cases.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There were two major drugs currently on the market, Exelon
and Reminyl, that could relieve some of the symptoms of Alzheimer's by boosting
the action of the brain chemical acetylcholine. However, Nina had not yet
declined to the stage where doctors would prescribe those drugs. To resort to
them was an admission you were at endgame, since they usually were effective
only for a few months.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So the Dorian Institute might well be a long shot worth
taking. Frankly, what's to lose?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This morning, she knew, was going to be difficult. If Nina</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>wanted to
stay and checked in, there would surely be a pile of paperwork. Ally had had
the foresight to acquire power of attorney for her mother three months earlier,
and she'd brought along that document in case it might be needed. And Maria,
the wonderful, ultimate caregiver, was there to help. The real challenge,
however, might well be trying to help Nina understand what was going on and
participate in the decision. This was the moment every child dreads, when you
have to face, really face, a parent's mortality.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As the green forests of northern </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New Jersey</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> began to envelop them, she slipped a
CD of Bach partitas for unaccompanied violin into the CD player. She had loved
to play them all her life, but now Dr. Ekelman had urged her to put her violin
into storage. Hearing the violin now reminded her of the other purpose of the
trip, the treatment decision she needed to make for herself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In that regard one of the things that kept running through
her mind was what Stone Aimes had said about the Gerex Corporation instituting
a news blackout simultaneously with a patient being mysteriously dropped from
the trials. Those concurrent facts did not need to be ominous, but they also
could use an explanation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What was she going to do? Was Van de Vliet's stem cell
procedure on her heart really worth the risk? She honestly didn't know. Even
though the violin had temporarily been taken away from her, she had hopes she
could gradually get it back. There were other ways to try to strengthen a
dysfunctional heart.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, she thought, wait and hear him out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>From the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>George</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Washington</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
 </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bridge</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> she had taken 1&#8209;4, which
turned into 1&#8209;208 and now the green forest held sway. It felt like she'd
gone through a time warp, from the beginning of the twenty&#8209;first century
to the end of the eighteenth. Then finally, as the second partita was ending,
the icy&#8209;cold </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Greenwood</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Lake</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
came into view. It was associated with those long </span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Finger Lakes</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> gouged out by glaciers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Driving past remnants of the last Ice Age, she reflected on
how insignificant humans are in the scheme of things. Suddenly she thought of
Aldous Huxley's novel After Many a Summer Dies the Swan, about a wealthy madman
who'd discovered a way to prolong life by eating the entrails of prehistoric
fish. Maybe it was seeing the lake that made her flash on that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was now on </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Greenwood Lake Road</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>, which passed around the west side, and there were numbers
on several gated driveways as she passed along. She suspected the place would
be somewhere along the middle of the lakeshore, and she was right.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After a few miles she came to a discreet sign announcing the
Dorian Institute, and a large iron gate that protected a paved roadway leading
into a forest of trees. That was it: just forest, no hint of a building, though
she saw signs of some kind of industrial park farther down the road. When she
drove up to the gate, she realized there was a video camera and a two&#8209;way
intercom.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When she reached out of the window and pushed the talk
button, she heard &quot;Good morning.&quot; And then the gates parted in the
middle and slid back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They must be expecting us, she thought, and drove through.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The road was cobblestone, or rough paving brick. It wound
among the trees for approximately half a mile and then widened.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There, framed by the lake in the background, was a
magnificent three&#8209;story building with eight Doric columns across the
front in perfect Greek Revival style. There were windows at ground level, but
they were heavily curtained.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Built of red brick, the building probably dated from the late
nineteenth century, and it looked every bit like an Ivy League dormitory.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Miss Hampton, I don't like the feeling I'm getting
about this place,&quot; Maria said quietly. &quot;It is very cold and formal
from the outside, but inside I sense a place where there is bad magic.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>In the </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Dominican Republic</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, we call it Santeria. I can always
tell these things.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally knew and respected Maria's sixth sense. But then Maria
sometimes still acted like a freshly minted citizen just off a green card, and
she had an innate suspicion of authority&#8209; evoking buildings. Her aversion
to the Dorian Institute might be nothing more than that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>On the other hand, Ally was having a bit of the same feeling.
There was something formidable and foreboding about the place that seemed out
of keeping with its supposedly benign purpose. She felt a moment of tightness
in her chest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There was a parking area off to the left, and she drove into
the nearest slot and turned off her engine. This was the moment she'd been both
anticipating and dreading. The clock on the dash read eleven&#8209;fifteen; she
was fifteen minutes ahead of the appointed hour.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, Mom, how do you feel?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nina turned and stared at her, uncertainty in her eyes.
&quot;Where are we, Ally? I don't recognize anything.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This is the institute I told you about last night. Can
you remember anything we talked about then?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This is the place you were ... Didn't you say there's a
doctor here who can do something for my... memory?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We're both here now to just talk to him.&quot; She
turned to the backseat. &quot;Maria, can you get Mom's purse?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She nodded, then reached hesitantly for the door. She was
clearly reluctant to get out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally walked around and opened the door for her mother.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, Mom, time to stretch your legs.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally held her hand and together they headed across the oval
brick driveway. Birds were chirping around them and she could smell the scent
of the lake, borne up the hill by a fresh wind. Then, through the trees, she
saw two women walking up the trail that led down to the lake. They were, she
assumed some of the patients.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They both looked to be in their early sixties, but also
athletic and nimble. One was wearing Nikes and a pale green pantsuit. The other
had on a blue dress and a white cap and Ally realized she must be a nurse.
She'd been taking the other woman out for a stroll.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They were engrossed in conversation, but as they approached,
the woman Ally had decided was on staff looked up and smiled a greeting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Can I help you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She introduced herself and Nina and Maria. The woman smiled
again but didn't introduce herself in turn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We're here to see Dr. Van de Vliet,&quot; Ally went on,
&quot;about the trials. But we're a couple of minutes early and I was wondering
if we could look around a bit first? I'm trying to understand what the
institute is really like.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, dear,&quot; the woman said, &quot;even those of
us who work here aren't allowed everywhere. You know, into the research lab in
the basement. Some places here have to be completely hygienic. Of course, for
patients who are in the recovery phase, strolling around outside is definitely
recommended, as long as they're able. But that's getting way ahead of
ourselves. First we'll have to check you in. There's a lot of paperwork for the
clinical trials.&quot; She seemed puzzled. &quot;They're almost over, you know.
But come along and I'll let him know you're here. He's always down in the lab
at this time of the morning. It's well after his rounds. They're so busy
now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then she turned to the other woman. &quot;Sophie, do you
think you can find your way back to your room? It's number two&#8209;eighteen,
on the second floor, remember?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Sophie appeared to be pondering the question for a long
moment before she huffed &quot;Don't be silly. I know exactly where it
is.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As she strode on ahead, the nurse watched her carefully, as
though unsure what she might do next. She pushed a buzzer at the door and then
a man in a white uniform opened it and let her in. Only after Sophie had
disappeared through the doorway did the nurse turn back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm Elise Baker. Please forgive Sophie if she seems a
little ... confused. Her procedure is still under way.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Her 'procedure'? What—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She was diagnosed with Parkinson's before she came
here. She's improved an enormous amount, but we're not allowed to say so.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why is that?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We're in clinical trials. No one is allowed to discuss
our results. Everyone here had to sign a secrecy agreement.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now Maria was helping Nina up the steps. The porch, with its
soaring white Doric columns, was definitely magisterial. The front door, however,
was not wooden or decorative. It was solid steel, albeit painted white to blend
in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Elise walked to the door, which had a video camera mounted
above it, and a split second later, it buzzed, signaling it was unlocked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This is a lot of security, Ally thought, for a clinic doing
research on cells. Are they worried about spies getting in, or patients getting
out?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But the locked steel door was just the beginning of the
security. Next they entered a small room just inside the door with an X&#8209;ray
machine to see into purses and parcels.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The first floor is reception and dining,&quot; Elise
explained as she swept through the metal detector. &quot;There are rooms— we
call them suites—upstairs for patients, and the research lab and offices are in
the . . . lower area.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What . . . what is all this security for?&quot; Ally
asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The work here is highly proprietary. No one is allowed
to bring in any kind of camera or recording equipment.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The guard dressed in white looked like a retired policeman,
with perhaps a few too many jelly doughnuts over his career. He had a beefy red
face and a hefty spare tire. But he was certainly alert to his
responsibilities, eyeing the three newcomers with scarcely disguised suspicion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In fact, Ally sensed a palpable paranoia in the air. Well,
she told herself, medical research is a high&#8209;stakes game. It's
understandable they would be concerned about industrial espionage.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After the security check, they went through another steel</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>door and
entered the actual lobby. The first thing she noticed was a grand staircase
leading up to the second floor, and then to the third. Off to the right was a
modern elevator with a shiny steel door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A number of patients were coming down the stairs and heading
for a hallway leading to the back. They were mostly women, whose ages ranged
anywhere from forty&#8209;five to well beyond seventy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Who are these people? Ally wondered. They must have been
sufferers of various kinds of debilitating afflictions, but now they were
certainly ambulatory, if not downright sprightly. She wanted to talk to some of
them, watching them moving along chatting and smiling, but this was not the
moment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;At eleven&#8209;thirty we have meditation in the dining
hall,&quot; Elise was saying as she led them through the lobby, &quot;for those
who care to participate, and after that a vegetarian lunch is served at twelve&#8209;thirty
sharp.&quot; Then she glanced back. &quot;After you see Dr. Van de Vliet—and
assuming you're admitted—there'll be an orientation and then you're welcome to
begin participating fully in our activities.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Actually,&quot; Ally said, &quot;if people are well
enough to be in 'activities,' why can't they be outpatients?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;These clinical trials require twenty&#8209;four&#8209;hour
supervision,&quot; Elise explained, heading for the wide desk in the center of
the room. &quot;Now, if you would all sign in here at the desk, Ellen can take
you downstairs to the medical reception.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A dark&#8209;haired woman smiled from behind the desk, then
got up and came around. A sign&#8209;in book was there on a steel stand. Ally
finally noticed that light classical music was wafting through the room,
Tchaikovsky's </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Swan</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Lake</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
suite.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You must be Ms. Hampton,&quot; the woman said.
&quot;And this must be your mother. We were told to expect you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She nodded a farewell to Elise, who said, &quot;It was so
nice to meet you. Good luck.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She then turned and headed for the back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally signed all three of them in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Good,&quot; the woman said as she checked the
information.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&quot;My
name is Ellen O'Hara, by the way. I'm in charge of the nursing staff here.
We're ready to go downstairs now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ellen O'Hara had a knowing, earnest face that fairly lit up
when she smiled. She had short brown hair streaked with gray and was pleasantly
full&#8209;figured.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When they reached the elevator, she zipped a small plastic
card through the reader on the wall and the doors slid open. As they emerged on
the lower level, Ally realized they were in the precincts of a very
sophisticated medical laboratory. Occupying most of the floor was a glassed&#8209;in
area, inside of which she could see three men and two women, all dressed in
white. She also noticed rows of steel containers that seemed to be ovens or
incubators of some kind as well as racks and racks of vials. At the far end of
the laboratory, there was a blackboard on which one of the men was drawing
something that looked like hexagonal molecules, linking them together.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's Dr. Van de Vliet,&quot; Ellen said pointing.
&quot;I'll let him know you're here. The laboratory is a special environment.
The entrance there is actually an air lock. The air inside is filtered and kept
under positive pressure.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She walked over to a communications module, buzzed then
announced into the microphone, &quot;Dr. Vee, your eleven&#8209; thirty
appointment is here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He turned and stared in their direction, then smiled and
waved. Next he walked to a microphone near the center of the room and clicked
it on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll be with you in a minute. Can you please wait in
the receiving room? And Ellen, can you start getting them ready?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course.&quot; She nodded then clicked off the
microphone and turned. &quot;Receiving is just down at the end of the hall.
Next to his office. Please come with me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She led them through a large wooden door, into a room with a
retractable metal table covered in white paper and several chairs. It was a
typical examination room, with a device on the wall to monitor blood pressure,
a stethoscope, and other examination paraphernalia.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If you'll kindly take a seat,&quot; Ellen said,
&quot;I'm sure he'll be here as soon as he can, in a few minutes at most. But
while we wait, I need to take your temperature and blood pressure, and start a
chart.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ally, where are we?&quot; Nina asked. Her face was
becoming alarmed, and Maria reached to comfort her. &quot;Are we in a hospital
somewhere?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, Mom, it's actually the institute I told you about
last night The doctor here wants to see if he can do anything to... help
you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Oh,&quot; she said, &quot;is he the one you told me
about? I thought that was just a dream.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, he's real. Whether he can help you or not that part
is what’s  still a dream. But we're all praying.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She looked around at the pure white walls and wondered again
what she was getting into. Meeting a new specialist in the sterile white cold
of an examination room, could be frightening in itself. God, how many times
before had she done this as she trudged through HMO hell? Maria was so
unsettled she was deathly pale.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ellen took their blood pressure and temperature, including
Maria's, even though she protested mildly, half in Spanish—a sign of how
unsettling it was to her. Ellen had only just finished putting all the numbers
on clipboard charts for each of them when Karl Van de Vliet opened the door and
strode in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Tuesday,

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>11:39
 a.m.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He had a high forehead and prominent cheekbones, just like in
the photo. And just as in his photo, there was a genuine dichotomy between his
face, which looked to be early forties and unwrinkled, and his gray eyes, which
were much older. That was it. That was what seemed odd. He was different ages.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Underneath his white lab coat he was wearing a black suit and
an open&#8209;necked blue shirt. Ally noticed that his fingers were long and
delicate, like those of a concert pianist, and overall he had a kind of ghostly
presence, as though he were more spirit than man. Although he looked exactly as
he did in the photograph in the Gerex Corporation brochure, in person there was
an added dimension, a kind of raw magnetism about him. It was more than simply
a physician's bedside manner, it was the allure of a pied piper. The first
thing you wanted to ask him was <i>How old are you, really?</i> Maybe the next
thing you'd want to do was ask him to dinner.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What had she expected? Maybe a self&#8209;absorbed nerd
researcher in wrinkled stained lab attire, anxious to scurry back to his test
tubes. But in person Karl Van de Vliet was debonair and youthful, living proof
that his photo wasn't retouched and was recent. He had to be twenty years older
than she was, easily, but to look at him you'd guess he was close to the same
age. She was dying to ask him about that but she couldn't think of a polite way
to raise the subject.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She introduced herself. &quot;We spoke yesterday.&quot; Then
she introduced her mother and Maria. &quot;Mom and I talked last night about
the clinical trials, and she said she's interested. This morning,
unfortunately, I'm not sure she remembers what we discussed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He placed a hand on Nina's shoulder and studied her face as
he smiled at her, embracing her with his eyes. &quot;Well, we're going to see
what we can do about that aren't we, Mrs. Hampton?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've got a question right up front&quot; Ally said.
&quot;Have we already been entered into the National Institutes of Health
clinical trials?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He seemed taken aback for a moment, caught off guard, but
then he stepped up to the question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;As a matter of fact I did take the liberty of
authorizing the preliminary NIH paperwork for both of you. Of course it doesn't
obligate you in any way. The thing is, there's a lot of red tape, so if you do
decide to participate, the sooner we get that part started the better. On the
other hand, if you decide not to, we can just terminate everything at this
preliminary stage and you won't even be part of the official record.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, Ally thought, that undoubtedly explains why Stone saw
our names on the NIH Web site. But why did Van de Vliet look so funny when I
brought it up?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He focused on Nina. &quot;Mrs. Hampton, I'm Dr. Van de Vliet.
You're a pretty lady, and we've had some luck helping other ladies like
you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Honey, if I had you in my bedroom, then maybe you could
help me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Oh my God, Ally thought, she's about to go ribald on us. But
that's a sign she's coming out of her funk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But then she had another thought. Maybe Nina sensed he was
older than he looked. Like that paranormal perception that told her Grant was
involved in something evil. So far, however, that particular perception hadn't
panned out (though Grant clearly was up to something).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Maria was mortified. She blushed and made a disapproving
animal noise low in her throat and turned her face away, but Van de Vliet
simply smiled even more broadly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mrs. Hampton, I don't think you should be talking that
way in front of your daughter.&quot; He gave her a wink. &quot;What you and I
do together is none of these people's business. But I do think we should
consider keeping them informed if only a couple of hints.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally found herself wanting just to listen to his voice. There
was an intelligent warmth about it that reminded her of a kindly professor at </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Columbia</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, a truly gifted architect who also
could quote Keats and make you cry. You wanted to give yourself to him. My God,
she thought, how am I going to stand up to this man?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There're some issues you and I need to discuss,&quot;
he said turning back to Ally. &quot;The first thing I need to do is take a look
at Mrs. Hampton’s records. But whatever they say, it won't do any harm to run
what we call a 'mental state examination' for her, to establish a general baseline
of cognitive impairment as of now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How long will that take?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Actually, Ellen can start in just a few minutes,&quot;
he said &quot;Of course, we'll need to hear about the usual danger signs
everybody knows. Does Mrs. Hampton have recent&#8209;memory loss? Does she get
confused about places and people? Does she have trouble handling money and
paying her bills?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The short answer is yes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>All of those things, Ally knew, had accelerated in the last
six months. It was the tragic, recognizable onset of the latter stages of
Alzheimer's. Already more than once Maria had said there were times when she
didn't think Nina recognized her. More and more she seemed to be confused,
unable some days to find her way around the apartment, and she'd started
repeating herself. She often had trouble finding the right words, and she was
increasingly paranoid and suspicious. Maria, who had worked with other
Alzheimer’s patients, feared she might begin hallucinating soon, seeing things
that weren't there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally turned to her. It felt obscene to talk about her when
she was sitting right there with them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mom, sweetie, do you understand what Dr. Van de Vliet
is asking? Do you think you have trouble doing everyday things?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She knew the answer but she was determined that her mother
not be treated like a potted plant.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ally, you know that half the time I can't remember a
blessed thing. I'm getting crazy as a bloody coot.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then Nina turned and looked Van de Vliet in the eye.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't want to lose my mind, Doctor. I don't want to
see the shade closing in. I can't do crosswords anymore. I used to do them all
the time. And all the music I used to know. It was my love and now . . . now I
can't tell Scriabin from Strauss half the time. It wasn't supposed to happen
that way. I thought my mind would go on forever.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mrs. Hampton, if you'll let me, what I want to do is
try to work on your recollection. I don't know how much I can help you with
crosswords, but then I've never been much good at them myself either. Your
memory of music should improve, though. There are no guarantees, but—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then I'm ready to try it, Doctor,&quot; she cut in.
&quot;You're all that stands between me and losing the only thing I have left,
my past&quot; Next came a burst of rationality. &quot;Now, I hate to be a pest
but could you explain what exactly it is you're going to do. I want Ally to
hear this too and then maybe she can go over it with me later and help me
understand it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He smiled and reached over and stroked her slightly thinning
hair. &quot;I'd be happy to try, Mrs. Hampton. It's actually pretty simple.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he turned to Ally. &quot;We touched on some of this on
the phone. Do you want to hear it again?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, I'm still trying to get it all into my simple
mind.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well,&quot; he began, &quot;to go back to the very
beginning of my interest in stem cells the focus of our research has been
directed toward challenging the notorious Hayflick limit. Back in the 1960s,
Professor Leonard Hayflick discovered that when tissue cells are taken from the
body and cultured in a laboratory dish, those cells grow and divide about fifty
times, give or take, and then they stop. They have reached old age, senescence.
The physical basis of the Hayflick limit is a section of DNA known as telomere,
which gets shorter each time the cell divides. Eventually the telomeres become
so short that all cell division stops. It's like an internal clock telling them
the game is over. They've had their innings.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And you're saying you've found a way to beat the clock,
to stop the telomeres from getting shorter?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All cells possess a gene known as the telomerase gene,
which can restore the telomeres to their youthful length. But in most cells the
gene is permanently repressed and inactive. It is only found in egg and sperm
cells, and in cancer cells.&quot; He gazed away for a moment as though
collecting his thoughts. Then he turned back. &quot;However, we've found that
by isolating and inserting an active copy of the telomerase enzyme into adult
stem cells, which can be found in minute quantities throughout the body, we can
set their clock back to zero. We extract cells, 'immortalize' them with
telomerase, and then return them to the body as a youthful infusion.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And is that what you'd be doing for Mom?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There'd be a series of injections, but given what
appears to be her level of mental awareness right now, the procedure probably
can be accelerated.&quot; He patted Nina on the shoulder.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All right,&quot; Ally said &quot;but can you use the
same procedure for someone's heart?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, yes and no,&quot; he said. &quot;Did you bring
your medical records? I should have a look at them before making any
pronouncements.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>To prepare for this moment, she'd printed off a copy of the
medical files she'd scanned into her computer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There're a lot of files,&quot; she said, opening her
bag. &quot;I've got copies of my EKGs over the past eleven years. Dr. Ekelman,
my cardiologist, says my condition is getting progressively worse.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She took the folder out of her bag and handed it to him. He
flipped through the files with what seemed an absent manner, almost as though
he already knew what was in them and was just going through the motions. Then
he looked up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, your physical condition looks pretty good. You
clearly exercise. And I don't see anything here that would suggest a
complication. As to how your procedure might differ from your mother's, I guess
the main area of concern is simply the scale.&quot; He laid her files on the
steel table. &quot;Your heart has reached the stage of aortic valve stenosis
where cardiac output no longer can keep up proportionately with vigorous
exercise. And that has put an even larger strain on an already weakened
condition. What we are about to undertake here corresponds to what might almost
be considered an aortic valve replacement, though it is done at the cellular
level. We call it regenerative medicine. Millions of cells will be involved We'll
attempt to reverse the calcification and also to develop new blood vessels that
supply the heart muscle.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know, this is so risky. I remember that not long
ago they tried to use fetal cell injections into the brain for treating
Parkinson's disease. And it turned out that the side effects were horrendous.
Why should I assume that this is any safer?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He looked pained. &quot;I assure you we don't do anything
here that is remotely like that particular, unfortunate procedure.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She stared at the ceiling trying to grasp what he'd just
said. &quot;So how risky do you think this is?&quot; she asked finally.
&quot;Truth time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He looked away again and sighed. There was a long silence in
which he seemed to be pondering some extremely troubling thoughts. Finally he
turned back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;In medicine there Is always something that can go
wrong. Even the most innocuous procedure can end up being lethal if that's what
the gods want that day.&quot; He looked at her intently and seemed to try to
measure his words. &quot;But I wouldn't recommend we proceed if I didn't feel
that the potential benefits far outweigh the risks.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She listened wondering. Something in his voice is sounding
cagey. What is he leaving out?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I still want to think about it&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course, but we can make some preparations in the
meantime,&quot; Van de Vliet said turning back to Nina. &quot;Mrs. Hampton, do
you understand anything of what I've said? Nothing is risk free.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Young man, if you'd lived as long as I have, and then
felt it all slipping away, you'd be willing to take a chance with
anything.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mrs. Hampton, Alzheimer's is one of the more promising
areas of stem cell research. We've already had successes here. I truly think we
can help you. In fact, Ellen can start your preliminaries right now, if you
like. A lot of it you may have done before. For example, there's a game where
you have to memorize the names of three unrelated objects, and you have to
count backwards from one hundred by sevens. Finally there's a test where you
copy sentences and symbols.&quot; He chuckled and there was a warmth but also a
distant sadness. &quot;Some days I'm not sure I could even do it all myself. In
any case, it's not something you pass or fail. But if we do enter you into the
trials, you'll have to stay here for the duration. That's absolutely essential.
We'd also like a caregiver to be here with you, as long as it's
necessary.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally looked at Maria. &quot;Do you think you want to stay
here with Mom?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Maria's eyes were very sad &quot;I could stay for a day or
two. But ... maybe we should talk.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We can arrange for someone,&quot; Van de Vliet
interjected &quot;We routinely provide caregivers from our staff when called
for. And because we're still in clinical trials, there is no charge.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally watched Nina brighten and turn to Maria. &quot;You can
bring some things from my closet when you go back. I want to start right away.
I just know he can help me. I've got a feeling and you know my feelings are
always right.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ellen reached and took Nina's hand. &quot;Come, dear, we have
a special office where we handle all the paperwork for admissions. We can do
the tests there.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally leaned over and kissed her mother. &quot;I love you,
Mom. And I love your spirit. You taught me how to be a fighter a long time ago.
And I guess you're still teaching me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Karl Van de Vliet watched the three women leave. Now he was
alone with Alexa. So far, so good, he thought. With her mother checked in,
we're partway there. Now what is it going to take to get her with the program?
I'm not sensing commitment. She's asking too damned many questions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It looks like we may have to go to Plan B tomorrow. Too bad.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After the door was closed, he turned back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your mother is quite an inspiration,&quot; he said with
a smile. &quot;I'll need those tests to create a baseline, but already I can
tell she'll almost certainly respond to the treatment. She fits our success
profile. I'd say the odds are heavily on her side.&quot; Then he darkened his
look, for effect. Better let her know I don't have to do this, he reasoned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The truth is, we already have enough data on Alzheimers
that I don't really need any further clinical trials. I know the parameters of
what the procedure can do and what it can't. But when Grant told me about his
mother's condition, I saw no reason not to work her into the trials. We're
winding down now and we have some empty beds.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't think I'm not grateful,&quot; she said,
&quot;even though I may ask a lot of questions.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She got the message, he thought. Good.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Alexa, I'm now going to tell you something I've never
told anyone else,&quot; he went on, feeling a tinge of sadness arise in his chest.
He hadn't planned to say this, but for some reason he now wanted to. Perhaps
because it was true. &quot;My late wife, Camille, was a brilliant medical
researcher. We worked together for many years, first at Johns Hopkins and then
at Harvard. What took her from me was a heart condition very similar to your
own. That was over a decade ago and I vowed I would dedicate my work to her. I
wanted the final clinical trial in this program to be on a young person with
advanced valvular stenosis, but I could never find a patient who matched that
profile. But you would be perfect.&quot; He looked carefully at her. It was all
so true, which made this whole scene especially poignant.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm sorry about your wife,&quot; Ally said. &quot;I
read in your—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You see, if I can succeed with you, it would almost
seem as though I'd had a second chance to save her life. You bear such a
striking likeness to her in several ways. You look something like her, but more
importantly I sense that you share her indomitable will.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So I'm not just another statistic to you?&quot; She
seemed to be trying to gauge the depth of his sincerity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No one here is a statistic, but you would definitely be
someone special.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I see,&quot; she said still sounding noncommittal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Am I getting anywhere? he wondered Just press on. You've got
to make this happen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All right, whatever you decide, we need to get some
preliminaries out of the way. For one thing, we must have a complete new
cardiology exam. Nothing in the file you brought presents an obvious red flag,
but still, it's essential that we have an up&#8209;to&#8209;the&#8209;minute
stress test. Toward that end I've taken the liberty of arranging for a checkup
at the New York University Faculty Practice Radiology on </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>East Thirty&#8209;fourth Street</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. Among other things, they can run a
high&#8209;speed computed tomography screening using ultrafast X rays. Also,
I'd like to see a phonocardiogram. A sonic analysis of 'murmurs' can tell us a
lot about valve abnormalities. Regardless of what you decide to do here, it's a
good idea for you to have this done regularly anyway.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You've already scheduled tests?&quot; Her tone of voice
told him she was mildly taken aback at the presumption.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's just that the NYU Faculty Practice is sometimes
difficult to get into on short notice. They can be booked for weeks in advance.
But a cardiologist I know there, Lev Amram, has agreed to make room for you
this afternoon. It's a professional courtesy. There'll be no charge. After
that, and assuming you want to proceed, you should get a good night's rest and
then come back here as early as possible tomorrow morning. You should pack for
a three&#8209;week stay, though we'll provide you with pretty much everything
you'll need here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Just get her here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know,&quot; she said, &quot;I was actually hoping
we could do this on an outpatient basis. I know you like to have your patients
here for constant observation, but I run a business that needs me there every
day.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Alexa,&quot; he said, putting every last ounce of
authority he had into his voice, &quot;this is not a conventional procedure,
and it's possible you might suddenly need special care of some kind. This is an
experimental clinical trial, so we don't know what can happen. That's why I
really must insist that you be here twenty&#8209;four hours a day.&quot; He
looked at her with great tenderness. &quot;We're talking about the possibility
of completely repairing your heart. Surely you don't expect just to drop by now
and then for that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All right, point taken,&quot; she said, &quot;but—if we
go forward with this—I'll need to hire at least one temp to be at the office
while I'm gone. Somebody to at least handle the phone. That could take
time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Surely someone there could manage to handle that,&quot;
he said. She's getting resistant again, he told himself. Don't let that happen.
&quot;And there's also the matter of your mother. I think it would be wise for
you to be nearby during the early stages of her procedure. When her mind starts
climbing out of the abyss, it's important for a close family member to be there
to provide a visual and emotional anchor. It truly can make all the difference.
I fully expect that her functions of attention and recall will return to those
normal for a woman her age, or quite possibly even better, but it will happen a
lot quicker if you're here to help her, to remind her of things.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This is a lot to digest.&quot; Ally turned and sat down
in a chair. &quot;All right, I might as well get the exam. It doesn't mean I've
agreed to anything here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He heard the ambivalence and knew he had no choice but to do
what he was going to have to do tomorrow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I will proceed on the assumption that you'll be
entering the program. Truthfully, if you don't, a week from now your mother is
going to be asking you why.&quot; He smiled. &quot;In any case, we need to have
those tests done in the city. Also some blood work here. We're affiliated with
a lab. I want to check your T&#8209;cells and certain other markers, like C&#8209;reactive
protein and homocystine. It's something you should do regularly anyway.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All right, then,&quot; she said finally. &quot;But
after that, let me go see how Mom's doing. Then I'll arrange things with Maria
somehow and drive back to the city.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;By the way, before I forget, we have to complete a
formal application for your mother to admit her into the clinical trials, and
we also need a signed liability waiver. I assume you have power of attorney for
her by now. If you don't, then we may not legally be able to proceed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I have it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then let's get started&quot; he declared almost certain
he had her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

rang.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He prayed this was the call he'd been waiting for. As a
gamble, a long shot, he'd requested that Jane Tully, his former live&#8209;in
lover and the Sentinel's part&#8209;time corporate counsel, do him a small
favor. After he hacked the NIH Web site, he'd asked her to pass along just one
question concerning Gerex to Winston Bartlett's corporate attorneys: Why had a
patient been abruptly and mysteriously terminated, without explanation, from
the clinical trials now under way by the Gerex Corporation? If that wouldn't
get a rise out of </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, he didn't know what would. It was
the only part of the corporation's encrypted NIH file that seemed irregular.
But would </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> take the bait?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He reached for the phone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Aimes here.&quot; Around him came the clatter of
computer keys and muted laughter from the direction of the water cooler.
Everybody had watched a Tivo of the latest Sunday night and they were still
critiquing the shows. Mondays were everybody's day off, so Tuesdays were the
first chance to catch up. The staff was also starting to rev up again for the
coming week's edition, everybody with the hope that their particular assignment
would have legs and make its author a household name. Stone, however, felt like
this was either the first day of the rest of his life or the last day of a
career built on dealing to inside straights. This cannot go on much longer, he
kept telling himself; it was an unstable condition. His soul was already over
the fence, keeping company with that wild, free ox he liked to muse about.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Stone,&quot; came a husky female voice, strained and
yet strong. Just as he'd hoped, it was Jane, whose office was down on the third
floor. &quot;Can you come down? Right now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Did you hear back from—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Stone,&quot; she admonished her voice growing urgent,
&quot;just come down. Do it now, all right?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sure.&quot; He paused a moment, wondering. Why did she
sound so upset? Had his plan somehow backfired? &quot;I'm on my way.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He glanced up at the fluorescent light over his head like a
pitiless hovering spaceship, and wondered if this was going to be the break he
had been praying for. There was a nervousness in Jane's voice that indicated
something major was afoot. Something was about to change.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He switched off his Compaq laptop and reached for his brown
corduroy jacket, which was hanging from a hook on the side of the glass&#8209;walled
cubicle. He straightened his brown knit tie as he stepped on the elevator, and
for some reason he found himself thinking of his daughter, Amy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He mimed a toast. Here's looking at you, kid.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was in the fifth grade and lived with her mother, Joyce,
in a small condominium nestled in the hills near </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>El Cerrito</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>, where his ex&#8209;wife grew up. Joyce was a television
producer who had left him to go back out there, where she got work as a garden
designer. When he got over the shock, he finally concluded she loved </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>California</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> more than she loved him. Maybe not
an unreasonable choice. But then she got custody of Amy, based solely on the
fact that his income was inadequate to send her to private school in </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New York</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> and the public schools were out of
the question. But Joyce had agreed that if he ever had the money, she could
live with him some of the time. This book, he hoped, would make that happen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He still didn't know why he and Joyce couldn't have made a go
of it. It had occurred to him that there was the real possibility she had
fallen in love with the idea of a dashing investigative reporter, not the
grueling reality. These days she had Amy all the time except for three weeks in
July, and he had so many things to regret he scarcely knew where to start.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He kept a year&#8209;old photograph of Amy on his desk, in a
frame far too expensive for a snapshot of a young girl on a black horse named
Zena. But it was Zena that his $1,500 a month in child support had helped to
pay for, and he felt it somehow bonded them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hi, Dad, from me and Zena, went the inscription.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Why was he thinking about her now? he wondered. The answer
was, because he wanted her world to be different from the one he had known as a
child. He hadn't had a father around, and that had left him with a lot of
anger. He didn't want the same fate for her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Amy's world, he knew, was going to be very different, no
matter what he did. To be young like her and starting out was a daunting
prospect these days. He wanted to make everything easier for her, but the only
thing he could give her now was a measly $1,500 every month and his unshakable
love.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Even so, that was more than his mother, Karen, got for child
support—from a natural father he had never actually seen in the flesh until he
was eleven. And that was a chance encounter....</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So, if this book got some traction and he got some
recognition, along with some economic security, he might be able to have Amy
come back and live with him. It was something</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>she'd said
she wanted to do, though he wasn't sure where he would keep Zena.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But all in good time. Now everything depended on the book....</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The elevator door opened and he stepped out on the third
floor. The receptionist, Rhonda, a dark&#8209;haired resident of Avenue A who
usually tried to flirt, looked at him as though he'd just been convicted of a
crime and nodded with her head toward the corridor leading to Jane's office.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Stone, you've really screwed up this time. You'll never
guess who's in there and after your scalp. What on earth did you do?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You mean—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This is a guy I've only seen in newspaper pictures,
though, needless to say, not in this upstanding rag.&quot; In her dismay, she
unthinkingly reached for the pack of Virginia Slims lying next to the phone,
momentarily forgetting that smoking had long&#8209;since been forbidden in the
building. &quot;You'd better get your ass in there. Jesus, he came in with a
bunch of lawyers, but then he told them to split. 'I'm going to handle the
fucker myself.' Quote, unquote. Right here by my desk.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Stone didn't know, with absolute certainty, who she was
talking about, but surely it had to be ... My God, he thought with a thrill,
maybe it worked. Maybe I've smoked him out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Truth tellers have nothing to fear, Rhonda.&quot; He
winked at her. &quot;I'm protected by the sword of the Lord. 'He is my rod and
my staff. He leadeth me beside still waters.'&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're crazy, you know that?&quot; She'd remembered
where she was and began putting the cigarette back into the pack. Then she
smoothed her short black hair. &quot;He leadeth you into the shit, handsome.
That's where He 'leadeth' you. You're adorable, but you're also a sane person's
nightmare.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Thanks,&quot; he said giving a thumbs&#8209;up as he
walked past her desk. &quot;I appreciate your unstinting praise.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He headed on down the hall, the plush gray carpet soft
against his feet. Could this be the break? he wondered feeling his hopes
cautiously rising. Had the Big Man himself shown up? Could it be that there was
something funny going on with that patient who got dropped?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But what? He still didn't have a clue.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he walked into the room, he felt as though time just
stopped. He had fantasized about this moment more and more as the years went
by. Now here it was. What next? He thought he had been emotionally prepared,
but now he realized he wasn't. Were they going to acknowledge the past, or were
they just going to act as though nothing existed between them?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That first chance meeting, when Stone was eleven, had been
when his mother threatened to sue </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
for formal child support. The threat of publicity caused the matter to be
immediately settled, as she'd hoped it would be. Stone had been sitting in the
law firm's reception area when </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> walked through. Each knew who the
other was, but Bartlett just stopped and glared at him for a moment before
moving cm. Stone had sized up the man who had abandoned his mother and only
barely managed to suppress an urge to leap up and lash out at him, if only to
say, Look at me. I'm here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He had not been in the same room with his father since, but
this time around he was definitely noticed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Winston Bartlett looked just as he did in news photos. He was
in his late sixties, with thinning blond hair that was cut too long and shaggy
in the back. Stone's first thought was that the tightfisted old rou6 should
spring for a better barber.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But it was </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s eyes that really caught him. They
were strong and filled with anger, but they also contained a hint of
desperation. They were very different eyes from the haughty dismissal he
remembered from a lifetime ago.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Good, Stone thought. I've finally made you squirm, Daddy
dearest. Nothing else I've done has ever gotten the slightest notice from you.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>For a moment they stood sizing up each other.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Stone,&quot; Jane said, &quot;this is—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I know,&quot; he said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Even though they had been practically married, he had never</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>told her
that he was the unacknowledged son of Winston Bartlett. He had never told
anyone. To him, his father had died before he was born and that was the story
he stuck to.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He naturally had a lot of complex feelings about that. He had
seen his mother struggling to give them a decent life, hoofing in the chorus
line of Broadway shows long after she should have, and a lot of his anger
remained. Now, though, Stone Aimes wanted nothing from the old man. Except the
truth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Miss Tully,&quot; </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
barked, glowering at her, &quot;I think you’d better leave us alone.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course,&quot; Jane said with a wry look, and in a
tactful instant she had slipped past them and out, gently closing the office
door behind her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't believe it,&quot; </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> said turning back after he watched
her leave. &quot;You're trying to blackmail me, you little prick. Which tells
me you're not half as smart as I thought you were.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Wait a minute! Did that mean Winston Bartlett has been
following my career? Stone felt a thrill in spite of himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I never knew you thought about me, one way or the
other.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was experiencing a curious sensation. Although he was in
the same room with his father for only the second time in his life, it felt
natural. They were having one of those age&#8209;old arguments. The younger generation
had just challenged the older generation, and because of that sparks were set
to fly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This was the kind of thing that was supposed to happen
between fathers and sons all the time. In fact, it felt good. It felt normal.
More than that, he was finally being acknowledged.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My God, he thought, I share DNA with this man and yet we have
so little in common.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he had a more scary thought: Maybe we have a lot in
common.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think it's time you told me what the hell you're up
to,&quot; </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> declared, ignoring the jibe.
&quot;How did you—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm trying to do us both a favor, but you're not
cooperating. If the Gerex clinical trials are going half as well as I think
they are, then it seems to me you've got everything to gain by publicity. I'm
trying to write the first book that tells the Gerex story. So why the hell
won't your legal flunkies let me interview Karl Van de Vliet?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's actually none of your business.&quot; </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s eyes abruptly turned cloudy.
&quot;I want you to stay the hell away from—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Right now I'm the best friend you've got in this world.
Believe me.&quot; Stone couldn't believe he was saying this. For how many years
had he loathed and despised this man? But now, for the first time, he actually
needed something from him. &quot;I want to tell the real story of what Van de
Vliet has accomplished. What Gerex has accomplished. It'll be the latest word
on stem cell technology. But your office keeps giving me the runaround.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We have a damned good reason to keep our work
proprietary just now,&quot; </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> declared. &quot;This is like the
Manhattan Project.&quot; His eyes bored in. &quot;The results of the clinical
trials are going to cause a press feeding frenzy, and I want to be in a
position to control that when the time comes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This is incredible, Stone told himself. We 're talking as though
we have no history. You have a granddaughter by me whom you've never even seen.
Don't you at least care about her?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've got a pretty good idea of what Gerex is doing and
I think it's going to be a milestone in medical history.&quot; Stone looked at
him, trying to figure him out after all these years. For all his bluster,
Winston Bartlett seemed like a man with a lot of vulnerabilities and
insecurities. He hadn't expected it. &quot;It so happens I'm a damned good
medical reporter and all I'm asking is to be the Boswell to Van de Vliet's
Johnson. I want to be the one to chronicle this historic moment. There's no one
who can do it better, believe me. </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Ill</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
even agree to embargo everything until I get a green light from Gerex. But I
want to start now and get it right&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You can't ethically know any details of the work,&quot;
</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> declared. &quot;So the question I'm
waiting to hear answered is, how did you find out–?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I can't reveal my source.&quot; Because, he told
himself, I still don't have one. All 1 have is guesswork. &quot;But I know that
Karl Van de Vliet is running the first successful clinical trials using stem
cell procedures. And I'm going to report on it whether you want me to or not.
So are you going to help make sure my facts are accurate?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm going to help make sure there's no reporting at all
till I say so,&quot; </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> went on. &quot;Anything you print
will be— by definition—irresponsible speculation and you can expect enough
legal action to—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The original schedule was that they'll be finished in
less than a month. I'm not going to publish anything before that I just want to
have the manuscript I've been working on ready when the Gerex story finally can
be told. It'll be the final chapter, the payoff. I'm going to describe your
clinical trials, and it would be better for all concerned if it could be the
'authorized' version. If you force me to publish without your cooperation, it's
not going to do either one of us as much good.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Again he wondered why </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
was so upset. What was it about that one terminated patient that made him freak
when he found out somebody knew? So freaked he charged up here personally, all
the way from his fancy corporate building in TriBeCa, to breathe fire and
brimstone and yell threats?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do I have to get a court injunction to put a stop to
this corporate espionage?&quot; </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
demanded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Everything I know is in the public domain
somewhere.&quot; Actually, Stone thought that's a serious out&#8209;and&#8209;out
lie. Nobody knows that a patient got mysteriously terminated from the trials.
&quot;I just want to work together with you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Even as he was saying it, Stone Aimes realized that it was
not in the cards, now or ever. He watched Winston Bartlett's eyes narrow.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What kind of contract do you have with this
paper?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Quite frankly, the terms of the contracts for employees
of this paper are confidential.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I knew I should have kept those fucking lawyers here.
It takes a shark to deal with a shark.&quot; Then he seemed to catch himself.
&quot;So if you're planning on writing anything about this, you'd be well
advised to get yourself an attorney, because you're sure as hell going to need
one.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Thanks, Dad.&quot; It just came out. Maybe he'd been
wanting to say it all his life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s
look was shock for a moment, and then it turned pensive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You don't think I take an interest in you, but I do.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yeah, you've really been around through thick and
thin.&quot; He felt the old anger of abandonment welling up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I took care of your mother. Whatever she did was beyond
my control.&quot; The eyes were switching to chagrin. &quot;Do you have the
slightest idea what I could do for you? I've . . . I'm not getting any younger
and I've been thinking about . . . with your medical background you could
easily have a place . . . I mean, if you've got a head for business, then
someday . . . So why do you fucking want to do this now? &quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Stone listened, trying to internalize what he was hearing.
Not only did Winston Bartlett know about him, he was finally thinking about
acknowledging him. Sort of.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Or was this just a bribe to hush him up?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Either way, it was too little, too late.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You've never given me anything and I've sure as hell
never asked. I'd just like for you to get out of my way so I can do my
job.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
stalked toward the door. Then he turned back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You'd better think long and hard about what you're
getting into. You can ask some of the two&#8209;bit reporters I've dealt with
in the past. They're fucking roadkill.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>With that pronouncement, he slammed the door and was gone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Stone stared after him, feeling his heart pump. It wasn't the
threat; it was the mixed emotions. For a moment, in spite of his better
judgment, he'd felt like he had a father, but then </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> became the enemy again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Then the door cracked open and Jane appeared, dismay
in her eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What was <i>that </i>about?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What was <i>what  </i>about?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've gotta tell you, that man doesn't know how to keep
his voice down. What was that about helping your mother? Karen. You never
talked about her much, but I sure don't remember you ever saying anything about
her and Winston Bartlett.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's because I didn't. Jane, there are parts of my
past life that I try not to think about any more than I have to.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;After the fact, it's nice to know that there were parts
of your life that you didn't see fit to share with me.&quot; She sniffed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe someday.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's a little late for that,&quot; she declared, hurt
lingering in her voice. &quot;Look, Stone, I don't know what you know that's
got </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> so upset, but he's not the best guy
in the world to piss off. He stormed in here, fit to be tied, personally
demanding to know how the hell did you have proprietary information about the
Gerex Corporation's clinical trials. He already seemed to know who you were.
Now I realize there's more to the story, somewhere back there in time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And what did you tell him?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I was completely blindsided for which I thank you. I
told him I didn't know anything about your sources, but I wouldn't reveal them
even if I did. He's our landlord but that doesn't give him subpoena power. He
doesn't have the right to barge in here and try to intimidate the Sentinel's
staff. We're current on the rent.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Stone felt a tinge of nostalgia. Sometimes her gold&#8209;plated
bitchiness was the very thing he admired most about her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, thanks for sticking up for me. Maybe I've got him
upset enough that he'll come around eventually and decide it's better to have
me inside the tent, where I can be monitored.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She snorted at the improbability of that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, Stone, as usual you're an idiot idealist and
dreamer. I'll tell you exactly what's going to happen. </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> is most likely on his cell phone
right now, as we speak, threatening the Family, trying to get you fired. He's
saying you're stealing proprietary information somehow and he's going to sue
the Sentinel for our last dime if we print a syllable of anything you write
about him. That's his next move, Stone. I expect my phone to ring in
approximately fourteen and a half minutes. Their attorneys are going to tell me
to tell Jay to get you under control. That's what's going to happen. The Family
does not want Winston Bartlett pissed off. Especially by the likes of you,
somebody who's always writing muckraking articles that make them real nervous.
Does anything I've said have the ring of logic to you? Or are you living in
some never&#8209;never land where the facts don't fucking penetrate?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hey, he thought, that's pretty good. Jane is in DEFCON 1 mode
today.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Depends on what you look at, the doughnut or the hole.
That is, the stick approach or the carrot. I'm betting he's going to split the
difference and try a little of both. He's going to cool off and then offer me a
few crumbs as an inducement to go away.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;God, you're so naive.&quot; She laughed in derision.
&quot;Winston Bartlett is not accustomed to having to ask anybody for anything.
So the fact he came up here this morning to try to get you to back off on
whatever it is you're doing must mean you've really got him psyched.&quot; She
stared at him. &quot;What is it, Stone? Tell me. What do you have on him?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Right now I'm more interested in what he thinks I might</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>have. And
the truth is, I don't really know. But it must be something pretty big.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Stone, why is it so hard to hate you? You can make a
person's life miserable and that stupid person will still root for you. God, I
don't know what it was about you.&quot; She paused a moment as though thinking.
&quot;Maybe you're just too honest. Or just too sincere. Maybe that's what it
was.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't try to butter me up. I know my weaknesses. But
dammit, Jane, I'm this close to the story of the century. And the paranoid
zillionaire who was in here just now yelling at me is trying to freeze me
out&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, please don't involve me in this anymore, Stone.
You've just provided me with a week's worth of unnecessary shit.  From now on,
any communicating you want to do with Gerex's attorneys is going to have to be
done by someone else. Trust me when I tell you I do not need this in my
life.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sweetie, wait till you see what I'm on the track of.
What the Gerex Corporation is doing at a small clinic out in </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New Jersey</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> is going to change everything we
know about medicine. And it's going to blow wide open the second they finally
let the press in on what's happening at the clinical trials they're now winding
up for the NIH. When they finally hold that big press briefing, I want to have
a manuscript already in copyediting. I want to be first.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then why is he so worked up over your question?&quot;
she mused. &quot;About somebody being dropped from the clinical trials?&quot;
She paused &quot;Incidentally, I can do without being called 'sweetie' by a man
I'm no longer screwing.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sorry about that.&quot; He winced. It did just sort of
slip out in this orgy of intimacy. &quot;But what I think </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> desperately doesn't want me to find
out is the reason that patient was dropped. And he's afraid I'm getting close.
Unfortunately, I'm not, and I just took my best shot at prying the information
out of him and—you're probably right—blew it.&quot; He was turning to leave.
&quot;But I'm, by God going to find out somehow. Just see if you can keep me
from getting fired for a little while longer. If I'm still working for the
Sentinel three months from now, you may get honorable mention in my Pulitzer
acceptance.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was bluff talk. But he believed it with every fiber of his
body. You've gotta believe, right?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

was. The way things look now, you 're the only shot I've got left.</span></p>

April 7 </span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What a day! When Ally finally settled onto her couch, after
giving Knickers a long walk, she was exhausted. She leaned back and kicked off
her shoes. There had been a few moments of tightness in her chest—maybe it was
psychological, anxiety&#8209;induced—but that was gone now. She thought about
calling </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New Jersey</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> to ask how Nina was doing, but she
doubted they would tell her anything.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She'd spent the latter part of the afternoon getting yet
another heart exam. After driving to northern </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New Jersey</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'> and back, she'd had a formal (and exhausting) stress test
for her heart at the New York University Faculty Practice. God, she was sick of
examining rooms and those blue paper shifts you put on backwards, as though it
was okay for doctors and nurses to see your bare ass. Then she put on shorts
and sneakers and an Israeli physician stuck wired suction cups all over her
chest and put her on a treadmill for seventeen minutes, boosting her pulse to
over 150, which was as high as he dared to go. Then he called Van de Vliet,
faxed him the charts, and they reviewed the squiggly lines for another ten
minutes.  Finally she had a high&#8209;speed CT scan, whose results were then
sent directly to Karl Van de Vliet's lab computer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The bottom line was, the damaged valve in her aortic
ventricle was deteriorating even more rapidly than her regular physician, Dr.
Ekelman, had thought, but her heart was still strong enough for the procedure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She wondered if she had gone this far because she was letting
hope outweigh a sober evaluation of the risks. Was this the sign of complete
desperation? Whatever she decided, tomorrow was the day, D day, decision day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She thought again about her mom, who had been bubbling with
hope when she looked in on her. Nina hadn't even been formally checked in, but
already she seemed transformed. It was enough for her just to entertain the
possibility that her mind could be renewed. That in itself was sufficient to
convince Ally to sign the consent agreement for Van de Vliet to go forward with
her procedure. He even offered to provide a car service to take Maria home to
the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bronx</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> after Nina was settled and resting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In her own case, the special injections for her heart, she
was far less sure what she thought. The part that bothered her most was having
to give herself entirely over to a person she scarcely knew. It was the kind of
ultimate surrender that she abhorred.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>While Knickers rummaged behind the couch for the remnants of
her rawhide chew toy, Ally momentarily considered calling Grant. She couldn't
think of a reason why except that he was the only coherent immediate family she
had left and this felt like a moment for pulling together. God, she missed
Steve. Sometimes she felt so alone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then she considered calling Stone Aimes, but she decided that
would seem pushy. The truth was, she'd enjoyed talking to him and she'd been
surprised at how comfortable she'd felt. Looking back over the elapsed years,
she couldn't remember exactly why they split up. There must have been a good
reason, but now she could only recall the good times. A picnic in </span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Central Park</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, or the time they took the </span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Staten Island</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> ferry at night just to see the
inspiring downtown skyline.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>With those jumbled thoughts cluttering her mind, she finally
got around to remembering she hadn't checked her phone machine. She got up off
the couch and went into the bedroom.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There were three calls and at first she thought she was too
exhausted to check them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But no, that was irresponsible. She was running a business...
</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hi, Ally, it's me.&quot; The voice was Jennifer's.
&quot;No emergency, but call when you get in and let me know how it went,
okay?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Not tonight. There was too much to explain and she was too
tired. She went to the second message.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hi, it's me again. I need you to look over the Jameson
design, that Italian&#8209;marble bath. They're having trouble getting the
ocher. Some kind of strike at the quarry. What can they substitute? But
remember, it's got to be absurdly overpriced or they'll assume it's crap. If I
don't hear back from you, I'll fax you some stuff in the morning.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Okay, she thought, these rich clients love to show off. I'll
get them what they should have ordered in the first place, knowing them. Stone
from the quarry near </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Agra</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, where they got the marble for the
Taj Mahal. That ought to be ostentatious enough. It’ll take an extra couple of
months, but that will impress them even more. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As she considered going to the third message, she had a
feeling of misgiving, though in truth there were several people she wouldn't
mind hearing from.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Or maybe the Dorian Institute had called about Nina. Maybe
she'd freaked. This whole thing was happening way too fast. In any case, she
didn't really want to talk to anybody right now. What she really wanted to do
was sit and think, maybe run the whole thing by Stone and get his take….</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She decided to check out the third message.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hi, it's your intrepid reporter, just checking in to
see how it went today. It's just after eight, and I'm at home. I may not be
able to afford this place much longer, given all the excitement I've had today,
so call me while I still have an apartment and a phone.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She felt a ripple of excitement and the feeling pleased her.
Maybe she did have someone stable and rational in her corner, someone who
understood the risks and possible rewards of going forward with the procedure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She'd put his number in her Palm, which was in her bag, and
she went back to the living room, poured herself a glass of wine, and then
retrieved it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She heard him pick up on the second ring.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hi, it's Ally. Thanks for checking on me. I'm really
not in the greatest shape at the moment.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Oh yeah? So how'd it go?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, I met Dr. Miracle. . . .&quot; She paused.
&quot;I don't know quite how to handle you, Stone. Are we having some kind of
reunion? The affair redux. Are we friends all over again? Two days ago, all we
had were memories. Then I start getting phone calls from you. I still don't
know what I'm supposed to think.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll tell you what I think. I think we're playing this
by ear. I don't know what you've been doing for the years that I haven't seen
you. I don't know what you know about me. So this is kind of like a blind date
with a lot of baggage.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I agree,&quot; she said, then hesitated. Her resolve
was melting. &quot;I might as well say this. Is it too late to come down and
talk? I thought I was tough enough to handle this on my own, but I definitely
could use psychological support.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Give me the address. I could use a little support
myself. I got tlhreatened today, I think, by somebody who would like to crush
me like a bug. And easily could. I'll spare you the ironies, but you and I may
have more in common than you think. My interest in the Gerex Corporation has
just gotten extremely personal.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>        
After she hung up, she felt energized and she decided to give Jennifer a call
after all. In truth, she wanted to tell her about Stone and to get her take on
whether seeing him was a good idea. Aren't these second&#8209;time&#8209;around
things always doomed?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hi, Jen. I'm home and I'm making all kinds of fateful
decisions.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So what happened? Are you going to be a guinea pig for
that clinic?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is that what you think it amounts to?&quot; She
couldn't tell how serious Jennifer intended to be. &quot;I'm still debating it
Mom loved the place.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, good. Good for her. But you're still not sure
about you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm leaning .  . .&quot; She paused. &quot;Jen,
somebody I used to see in college is on his way down here right now. He's a
medical reporter, but the truth is, I don't know why I asked him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I guess if I were your shrink, I'd ask, 'How do you
feel about that?'&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If I knew the answer to that, I wouldn't need you to be
a one&#8209;woman support group.&quot; She bit her lip. &quot;He's doing a book
about stem cell procedures. So in a way it's a lucky break that he appeared
exactly when he did.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yeah, Ally, if you ask me, it sounds like it was a
lucky break in more than one way. An old flame reappearing can be a positive
sign. It's high time something happened in your life.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>You 're tighter than you know, she thought. I'm ready for
this, whether I admit it to myself or not. But is there going to be any
chemistry when we actually see each other? There used to be a lot.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The embarrassing thing was, her first thought was to wonder
if he was still terrific in bed. She remembered thinking he was very adroit
back then, but back then she didn't have much experience to compare him with.
Mainly, thinking about him now made her painfully aware she was overdue for
some closeness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Tuesday,

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>10:22 PM</span></i><i><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What's she going to think of me? Stone wondered as he knocked
gently on the door. She'd buzzed him up from the lobby without a word.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>More to the point, he thought, what am I going to say if she
wants an opinion about whether she should undergo the procedure or not? So far,
the only evidence I have that the clinical trials are working is
circumstantial, the patients who've been through the sequence and discharged.
So how can I, in good faith, advise her one way or the other?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But, he then concluded, I'm getting way ahead of myself. She
may take one look at me and decide she was right to dump me the first time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nice building, though. Housing for grown&#8209;ups, not like
the one&#8209;bedroom starter setup I've been reduced to.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He knocked—he always hated the idea of ringing a bell on an
apartment door—and a second later, it opened.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Alexa Hampton and Stone Aimes just stood awkwardly for a
moment and stared, taking each other in. Finally...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You look... great.&quot; They both said it
simultaneously, and that served to make the moment even more awkward.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well,&quot; he said finally, into the silence, &quot;you
do.&quot; And he meant it. There was, however, a lot of strain on her face, in
her eyes. The mark the years had left seemed more psychic than physical.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You don't look so bad yourself.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;God, it seems like a lifetime ago when we went to our
separate corners,&quot; he said after another long, contemplative pause. Then
he stepped in and she closed the door. He didn't try to peck her cheek, for
which she looked relieved. ”Tell me how you're doing, really.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You really want to know? Okay, this afternoon I had a
heavy&#8209;duty heart checkup. Nobody wants to put odds on this thing, but my
condition is getting worse.&quot; She led him through to the living room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then we should talk,&quot; he said looking around.
&quot;I love your loft, by the way. You make me envy you. You should see the
makeshift quarters I live in. I'm sort of waiting for my ship to come in.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The truth is, Stone, that I no longer know the first
thing about you or your life. And I think I'd like to.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot; 'Had we but world enough, and time.'&quot; He smiled
&quot;We'll get around to the catching up, but I don't flatter myself that you
asked me down at this hour to reminisce about our respective pasts.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You've already got me figured out.&quot; She made a
face. &quot;I don't know whether I like that or not. By the way, would you care
for something? You used to like scotch, right?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The operative part of that statement is 'used to.'
These days I try to avoid anything harder than beer. I was starting to have an
ethanol dependency problem. I think it's a common occupational hazard for a
reporter.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't keep beer around. It's fattening. How about
some diet cranberry juice?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe I'll have that scotch after all.&quot; He
laughed. &quot;I have a feeling it might be more suited to the occasion.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Know what, I think I'll join you.&quot; She walked into
the kitchen and started making the drinks. &quot;On the rocks, right?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Good memory.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Stone, I asked you down because I've got to make a big
decision.&quot; She was bringing the drinks into the living room.
&quot;Tonight. You're the closest thing I've got to a knowledgeable sounding
board. You have some idea of the risks and rewards here. So do I check into the
Dorian Institute and let them start injecting doctored&#8209;up stem cells into
me or not? Turns out that's what Van de Vliet wants to do.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We're in worse trouble than we thought.&quot; He took a
scotch. &quot;You've at least seen the place. I don't have a shred of actual
physical evidence that those clinical trials are producing results. I can make
inferences from what I see on the Web site, but it's nothing you can take to the
bank.&quot; He ventured a sip, then looked up. &quot;By the way, did you get a
chance to ask about the patient who got dropped?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Oh shit, I forgot.&quot; She sighed. &quot;There was so
much going on, with Mom and all the rest, that it completely slipped my—”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't worry about it,&quot; he said with a sigh.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Come on, Ally, she thought, this could be really important.
You've got to get focused.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll try to remember tomorrow.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I do think it's kind of vital. But be careful not to
mention my name. I've ... I've just acquired some problems of my own with the
Gerex Corporation.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What kind of 'problems'?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let me take a rain check on answering that. Suffice to
say, they're not thrilled about the idea that I'm doing a book in which they're
prominently featured.&quot; He paused. &quot;Look, Ally, there's a lot going on
here. Including that patient who was dropped for some reason that nobody wants
to disclose. But if you do decide to do it you couldn't have a better
physician. Karl Van de Vliet is quite possibly the world's leading researcher
in stem cell technology. On the other hand, this is the first time there've
been actual human trials. If anybody tells you there's no risk, then they're
not behaving ethically.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, the way things stand now, I'm due out there at
the institute at ten<span style='text-transform:uppercase'> a.m</span>.
tomorrow. If I want to, I can be formally entered into the clinical trials on
the spot. I've passed my qualifying exam.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know the trials are almost over. It's like they're
taking you at the last minute.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's what he said. I'm going to be the last ...
whatever. My friend Jennifer just called me a guinea pig. Van de Vliet also
said I'd have to stay out there for at least a couple of weeks, probably
longer. That's going to be a bloody drag, since things are really busy down at
CitiSpace now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ally, given what I know, or don't know, I don't have an
entirely good feeling about this. It could be they're hiding something, but I
don't have a clue what it is. It's quite possibly connected to that patient who
got terminated. And when I tried to raise this with Gerex's attorneys, no less
person than Winston Bartlett himself went ballistic.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What are you saying? That I shouldn't do it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, I can't make that decision for you. But one
possibility would be to just play along for a day or two and see if you can't
find out a little more about what went wrong with the patient who was
dropped.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Stone, that's maybe a little paranoid. Couldn't a
single patient have been dropped for a whole bunch of different reasons?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course, but it's not that simple. A patient was
dropped from the Gerex clinical trials, and there was no official reason given
in the data file. It made me curious enough that I had our paper's attorney
pass along a question about it to their attorneys. That motivated Winston
Bartlett to come personally to threaten me. So why is a guy who runs a huge
conglomerate suddenly afraid of one tiny question? Is there some problem, some
reaction to the procedure that they're terrified will come to light? Ultimately
millions and millions of dollars are at stake. I want the book I'm writing to
tell the whole story, not just the part they'll want to have told. That's why
God put reporters on earth.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Shit, Stone, I'm glad you're here. I think I told you
on the phone, I had someone I loved very much disappear on me some years ago,
and I'm feeling very alone at the moment.&quot; She looked him over.
&quot;Okay, I'll ask. We're adults. Are you married, divorced, attached,
unattached, seeing someone, alone and suicidal, what? I mean, where do things
stand here?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Where things stand is that I'm very happy that I
stumbled into you after all the years. And yeah, I've got a little history. At
least I'd like to think so. But nothing is going on at the moment.&quot; Then
he told her about Joyce, the divorce, Amy. &quot;And what was that you said about
having somebody disappear on you?&quot; He studied her, reaching back for the
feelings that were still buried. Seeing her was bringing it back. &quot;What
did you mean by that? Disappear like a missing person, or disappear as in up
and split, or—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He was my husband, Steve, and he was a political
consultant. He was in a single&#8209;engine Cessna that went down in the rain
forest in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Belize</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> and I miss him terribly.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm so sorry, Ally. Nothing that's happened to me comes
close to that tragedy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It gets worse. A few months before that, my dad had an
accident with a Browning shotgun that was no accident.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Jesus. What's that line about how the troubles tread on
one another's heels. Was he depressed? I guess that's a stupid question.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He thought he was going to lose his business. After a
lifetime of work. What do you think?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ally, I'm really sorry about all that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, I suppose it could be worse. As I recall, you
never knew your dad, did you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When am I going to tell her the truth? he asked himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let's get off the history topic tonight, what do you
say. We'll both get ourselves depressed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Agreed.&quot; She sipped at her scotch. &quot;So ...
you're saying I should play along and see if I can find out something about
this discharged patient, the mere mention of whom causes grown millionaires to
become unhinged?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's what / would do,&quot; he said, finishing off his
scotch and settling the glass on a coaster on a side table. Then he got up.
&quot;I have to tell you, Ally, you look awfully tired. I'd love to be
responsible for keeping you up all night, but I doubt that would be a humane
act.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It might remind me of a time long ago and not so far
away,&quot; she said with a faint smile. &quot;But you're right. When I get
this tired, I can precipitate an episode.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'd offer to drive you out there tomorrow, but that
would just get you in trouble. They probably have orders to shoot me on sight.
I'm the number one persona non grata with the top management of the Gerex
Corporation at the moment. So I'm the last person you want to be seen with.
Right now the only way you're going to find out what they're hiding is if
nobody suspects anything. Which means you've got to show up alone.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Maybe that's true, she thought. But you're a person I'd like
to be with tonight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Thanks for coming over.&quot; She walked over and
pecked him on the cheek.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>You 're vulnerable tonight, she told herself, wanting to ask
him to stay. Don't start making any big life decisions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Winston Bartlett looked at the white phone on the oak end
table beside his chair and argued with himself about picking it up and calling
the Dutchman. When Van de Vliet was at his office at the institute, they
communicated by encrypted videophone. By this time, though, he was usually
home, but he still hadn't called to say what had happened with Alexa Hampton.
Now they would have to talk over an open line. Damn him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After his explosive run&#8209;in with Stone Aimes—damn him
too—</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> had gone up to the </span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Park Avenue</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> place to check on Kristen firsthand
and try to console her. But he wasn't actually sure she recognized him; at
times she seemed to and then at other times she would just stare at him
blankly. Her mind increasingly had an in&#8209;and&#8209;out relationship with
reality, and today was an out day.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The time had come to be deeply concerned about her. She
couldn't be kept under wraps forever. He had checked her into the Dorian
Institute under an assumed name, Kirby Parker, to try to avoid any publicity.
Now that was the only</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>name she
could remember. How had the Syndrome done that to her?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Kristen Starr, whose identity was known to several million
watchers of cable TV, could no longer remember her own name. Karl had worked
with her every day, but no medication he had tried had even minimally slowed
the Syndrome's progress.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Beta had seemed so promising. Kristen's body had been
rejuvenated—her face was looking like she'd had perfect plastic surgery, and
there'd been no discernible side effects. It was everything they’d all hoped
for. Kristen was elated and even the normally cautious Van de Vliet was buoyed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Yes, the Beta was so close. Karl had to find a way to make it
work.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In spite of all Winston Bartlett's entrepreneurial derring&#8209;do,
he always knew he was at the mercy of time. He was getting ever closer to that
final dance with destiny. But . . . but what if the Beta could be made to work
the way Van de Vliet theorized it might? Was there the possibility the music
would never stop?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nursing a second Glenfiddich, he looked around the room, the
third&#8209;floor study/bedroom, finding it pleased him as always. This room of
his five&#8209;story mansion was a handmade gem from </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New York</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s turn&#8209;of&#8209;the&#8209;century
Gilded Age, with molded plasterwork ceilings and brass doorknobs and mahogany
paneling. Favorites from his superlative Japanese sword collection lined the
walls, giving him constant joy. He wanted to live to enjoy it for another </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>three score</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> and ten.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The only galling thing about the place was that he had to
share it with Eileen, who had the top two floors. They had been living in marital
purgatory for the past twenty&#8209;eight years, ever since she found out about
the existence of his natural son. Because of that humiliation, she had refused
to give him the one thing he most wanted from her, his freedom. She let it be
known that as long as he flaunted a string of mistresses in the cheap tabloid
press, she was determined to stay in his face.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He sighed and took a last sip of his scotch, then set it down
and clicked on the phone. Van de Vliet had rented a small villa half a mile
down the lakeshore, south from the institute, and he lived alone. Until
recently he'd been sleeping in the lab. There was no encrypted phone where he
lived, so this had damned well better be brief.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Karl, it's me. How did it go today with the new Beta
prospect? I contracted her to do some work here, hoping to do my part to get
her with the program. I was expecting to hear from you by now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've met with her and she had a stress test this
afternoon in the city. Other than the aortic stenosis, she seems to be in
superb shape, which is important. I'm assuming—make that hoping—that she'll
come back in the morning and formally enter the clinical trials. I'll let you
know if she does. Till that happens, I have no progress to report.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All right, but how soon after that do you think you
could get started with the Beta matter?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There was a pregnant pause, and then . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;W.B., we truly need to talk, and maybe not on this
line. Just before I left the lab, I ran another simulation on the Mothership to
try to figure out what dosage level of Beta enzyme would be safe. But it's like
trying to extrapolate backwards, and I just don't have enough data. I'm
beginning to wonder if using her to try to create telomerase antibodies is
actually such a good idea. It's just so risky. . . .&quot; His voice trailed
off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Karl, everything in life is a goddam risk. I know I'm
supposed to be the beneficiary here, but if the antibody concept works out, we
might still be able to do something for... Beta One.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm already doing everything I know how for her. That's
a tragedy we're all still in denial about. And now we're talking about risking
yet another woman. Yes, maybe it's the answer, but for now I don't know what a
safe dosage of enzyme should be. It has to be enough to generate the
antibodies, but not so great that . . . You know what I'm talking about.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I sure as hell do, </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
thought. I'm looking at the Syndrome myself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Karl, just think of what it could mean if you could get
the Beta to work the way the other procedures do. What great medical discovery
didn't have a few missteps at the beginning? This is experimental medicine that
could change the world. So, dammit, we've got to take risks.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why are we having this conversation at this time of
night? Over an unsecure phone?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Because we don't have a lot of time,&quot; </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> growled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We've got nineteen days left on the clinical trials.
That's certainly enough time to conclude the procedure on her heart. But if we
also try to—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Karl,&quot; </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
said &quot;it's the Beta we should be focusing on. I'm looking at the Syndrome
myself now, though I think I've got the strength of will to handle it. My mind
is a lot stronger than Kris . . . Beta One's. But I don't want to have to find
out. You've got to get this fucking problem fixed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If we do use her, I can't begin to tell you how
unethical this is about to become.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
wanted to remind Van de Vliet that ethics were the least of their problems at
the moment, but that wasn't the kind of thing you aired over an unsecure phone
connection.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Karl, just fucking do it,&quot; he said finally.
&quot;If she's not under way with the Beta before the end of this week, ethics
are not going to be your primary concern. I may have to revisit some of our
agreements. Cross me and you forfeit a lot.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All right&quot; He sighed. &quot;I know what I can do
to make sure she's in.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Good. Do it, whatever it is.&quot; He now had to warn
Van de Vliet about Stone Aimes, but how much information should he provide? He
quickly decided to keep it simple. &quot;Oh, and as though we didn't already
have enough problems, there's something else I need to alert you about. There's
a smart&#8209;ass reporter from the New York Sentinel nosing around. Yesterday
he got to my legal department and asked about Beta One, though he doesn't know
her name yet. He somehow found out she was terminated from the clinical trials.
Please tell me you haven't been talking to the press behind my back.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My God, I've been waiting for this to happen.&quot; Van
de Vliet sounded like someone who had just had the wind knocked out of him.
&quot;You know, Grant once mentioned that a reporter had been pestering him
about getting an interview with me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;When?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe two months ago, possibly three.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;First I've heard about it,&quot; </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> said. &quot;I wish he'd told me. I
could have taken steps.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It might be the same person. Now that I think about it,
I do remember he mentioned the Sentinel. How much do you think he knows?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm not sure. The question in my mind is, how did he
find out about her in the first place? He's supposedly doing a book about us,
Karl, a book about this project.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, that's the first I've heard about that. Christ! A
book!”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think he's just fishing at the moment. But this
should be a warning. We've got to keep security tight.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you know about him? Is he good?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Yes, </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> thought, he's damned good. The truth
is, I'm almost proud of him sometimes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He's the medical columnist for the paper. So happens, I
own the building where their editorial offices are.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't have time to read newspapers.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, he's good enough that we may have to handle him
somehow.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What are you trying to say?&quot; Van de Vliet asked,
though he sounded like he already knew.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What I'm saying is, he's a pro, and I get the strong
impression he's hungry.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hungry for money or for fame?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If I knew that, I'd know what to do next,&quot; </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> said. Probably some of both, he
thought, if the kid is anything like his old man.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then why don't we give him an interview? Meet the whole
matter head&#8209;on. I've always found it better to shape the news yourself
rather than trying to stonewall, which usually means a lot of speculation ends
up getting published and then you have to correct it after the fact. It's also
the best way to find out how much a reporter already knows.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Idiot, Bartlett thought, that's the worst possible thing we
could do. This kid would have your balls for a bow tie.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Karl, you've just provided a perfect illustration of
why I have my own people handling the press. Some amateur like you starts
talking to a guy like that, and the next thing you know, you might as well be
on sodium pentathol. Again, his name is Stone Aimes. Remember it. And don't
ever even think about exchanging a single word with him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;W.B., my experience is that you can only stonewall the
press for so long, if they're any good at all. Sooner or later, they're going
to find out more than you want them to. The only way to forestall that is to
parcel them carefully controlled information to work with. Trust me. I've had a
little experience with reporters too. You can't treat them like they're
complete dolts. You have to co&#8209;opt them, bring them into your confidence,
and then convince them that it's in everybody's interest for them to help you
rather than harm you. So why don't you let me talk to this guy? We could always
start off with the carrot and then move on to the stick.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This conversation is making me very nervous, Karl. I
don't want you or any of your people within a mile of him. I mean it,
goddamit.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>With which Winston Bartlett slammed down the phone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Shit.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What are we going to do? So far, Van de Vliet hadn't helped
Kristen in the slightest. Okay, she wanted to try the Beta, but still . . .
What happened was a tragedy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And who are we kidding—Stone wasn't going to back off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Seeing his natural (and only) son again after a lot of years
had shaken him up more than he had expected. At some level he wanted to feel
proud of his own flesh and blood.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But now . . . if anything got published about the Syndrome,
the financial consequences could be devastating. Stone Aimes had to be kept at
bay long enough to complete the buyout. Unfortunately, it might come to involve
force.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He smiled to think that Kenji Noda would be ready for that
challenge.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But overt violence really wasn't Winston Bartlett's style. At
least it hadn't been his style up to now. But he was staring at the horrific
possibility of the Syndrome. Starting very soon, a lot of things might have to
be handled differently.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally was walking down the second&#8209;floor marble hallway
of the Dorian Institute, feeling a mixture of hope and dread. She’d parked her
blue </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Toyota</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> in the same slot she’d done the day
before, and then she’d gone through the security check at the front entrance,
which included verifying (again) a solid ID and a check for any kind of camera
or recording equipment. Maria did not come along; she was using this as an
occasion to have some well&#8209;deserved time off with her grandchild. The
caregiver was giving herself some care.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The downstairs foyer had been empty except for security and
staff, and she’d paused just long enough to sign in and ask the receptionist at
the central desk which room Nina Hampton was in. Was her mother going to be as
enthusiastic about being here today as she’d been yesterday? Truthfully, just
to see her spirits immediately improve yesterday was a high in itself. But who
knew? Maybe she could be helped.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think she's . . . Let me check.&quot; She'd pulled up
a computer screen. &quot;Right. Mrs. Hampton is in room two&#8209;thirteen,
second floor.&quot; She'd looked up and smiled. &quot;Your mother, I assume.
She's quite a card. I hear she's doing very well. You can use the elevator over
there.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll take the stairs,&quot; Ally had said. They were
wide and blue marble and had a kind of splendor as they seemed to literally
flow down from the upstairs landing. &quot;I didn't have my run this
morning.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The marble hallway upstairs showed no signs of use. The place
felt more like a grandiose palace from another time than a hospital doing
cutting&#8209;edge research. There was a nurse's station at the far end of the
hall and two women were there in blue uniforms. Other than that, however, there
was nothing to suggest the Dorian Institute was a medical facility. It could
easily have been an exclusive resort hotel. It didn't feel medical or aseptic
in any way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Stone should see this, she thought. He'd definitely be
impressed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Driving out this morning, alone, she'd been thinking about
him a lot. There was something about him that was different from what she'd
remembered over all the years. He was as serious as ever about his work, but
she suspected he might possibly be more fun now that he seemed to have
lightened up some. He used to be wound extremely tight. In any case, she was
finding herself surprisingly happy to talk to him again, whether or not it went
any further.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But was his concern about the mysterious terminated patient
justified? And what, if anything, did that have to do with her?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was still musing about that when she heard the Spanish&#8209;
language TV going in room 213, even before she touched the doorknob. That's a
good sign, she thought.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She pushed open the door and strode in. The room was
decorated in earth tones, including a lovely brown hand&#8209;woven carpet,
which had Indian symbols in it, probably Navajo. The bed was a single, but it
was faux Early American, not a hospital bed. Again the place felt more like a
resort than a research institute.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nina was sitting up, leaning against the headboard, and
wearing blue silk pajamas underneath a white bed coat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mom, how're you feeling? You look great.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was true. She was wearing a lull complement of makeup and
her hair looked like it'd been newly washed. Whatever else was going on, the
Dorian Institute was making sure patients looked their best. Do they have a
beautician on staff ? she wondered. Also, there was a sparkle in her mother's eyes
that she hadn't seen since before her father died.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How does it look like I'm feeling?&quot; Nina reached
for the remote and muted the sound from the TV</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Yes, that old twinkle is definitely there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Gee, I have to say that you seem a lot better than you
did yesterday.&quot; It was true, thank goodness. She was having one of those
supercogent days.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She laughed deep and resonant. &quot;Ally, you have no idea.
He started in with the injections yesterday evening, after you left. When I
woke up this morning, I could remember everything that happened yesterday. I
even remembered why I was in this strange place. Try me. Ask me something and
see if I can remember it. Go ahead. Ask me anything.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay.&quot; She thought a moment. It should be
something easy. &quot;When was Dad's birthday?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;March twelfth.&quot; She didn't even hesitate.
&quot;You'll have to do better than that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How about my birthday? You couldn't remember it last
week.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nina paused and looked disoriented for a moment. Uh&#8209;oh,
Ally thought, I pushed her too hard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It was October third.&quot; A smile abruptly took over
her face, as though she was experiencing a live breakthrough. &quot;You were
born at </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Roosevelt</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Hospital</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>,
at three&#8209;forty in the afternoon.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mom, this is incredible.&quot; She was joyously stunned
though it felt like something resembling shock. &quot;It's a miracle.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your mother's responsiveness is impressive,&quot; Karl
Van de Vliet said as he strode through the open door, startling her.
&quot;Ellen will run the first battery of monitoring tests later this morning.
Short&#8209;term memory and the like. But from all appearances, there's been a
lot of tissue regeneration under way overnight.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is . . . is this permanent?&quot; Ally asked, not
wanting to let herself get her hopes up too soon. And what is he doing?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No one can answer that question.&quot; He looked at
Nina and smiled. &quot;But this is not some drug regimen to trick the brain's
chemistry, Mrs. Hampton, you have my word. In Alzheimer's, tissue responsible
for the production of certain neurotransmitters dies. What we're doing here is
enabling your brain to regrow healthy, long&#8209;lived tissue to replace what
has become damaged and destroyed by an excess of the wrong . . . Let's just say
we're not trying to salvage damaged tissue. We're actually replacing the
dysfunctional tissue in the cortical and hippocampal regions of the brain, so
we're working with the body. And you're responding wonderfully.&quot; He turned
back to Ally. &quot;I've got to get back to the lab now. Come on down when
you're ready, and we'll finish the paperwork.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She started to say she wanted to ask him to linger a moment
and answer a few questions, but before she could, he'd disappeared into the
hallway.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ally, I haven't felt this alive in months,&quot; Nina
bubbled on. &quot;Dr. Vee did a minor procedure late yesterday afternoon, using
local anesthesia. Then he did something in his laboratory and came back and
gave me an injection. Then there was another one this morning. It's supposed to
continue for a week or two. Ellen said she'll be giving me one of those little
memory tests every day to see if I'm improving, but you know, I already know I
can tell a difference. It's just been overnight, but I swear some of the haze
is already gone.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm so happy for you.&quot; Ally felt a surge of joy.
Already she was thinking about some new trips they could take together.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Come over here and sit by me,&quot; she said, patting
the bed. &quot;I was thinking about Arthur again this morning. If Doctor Vee
can do something for your heart, it would be a miracle that would have meant so
much to him. It's just so sad he can't be here to see this.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Ally settled next to her, Nina reached over and took her
hand. &quot;I want to ask you something, darling. Just between us. Why do you
think Seth . . . Grant is doing this for me, for us?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Ally was trying to read her
thoughts, wondering where the topic was headed. Nina had declared on Sunday
that she thought there was something evil about Grant. Now this.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I hate to say it about my own son, but caring is not
his first nature.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mom, we see him so seldom, do you really think either
one of us still understands him?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nina and Grant had never been all that close. In fact, he'd
always been something of a secretive loner within the family, even though he
was very much an extrovert with his friends, of which he had many, or at least
used to. Ally had left for college just as he reached high school, which meant
she wasn't around during his impressionable teen years. And when she came back
to take over CitiSpace, he was virtually a fugitive from the family.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I remember plenty about him. You think I don't know my
own son, Lord help me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, Mom, I'm not really prepared to talk about him.
It was so upsetting just to see him, I couldn't really take everything
in.&quot; She smiled and touched Nina's brow, which felt warm and flush.
&quot;But I'll tell you something I am taking in. You're really looking great.
I don't know what he's doing, but—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hope, darling. It's the greatest tonic in the world
even if there's no good reason for it.&quot; She squeezed Ally's hand.
&quot;And I do so wish Arthur could be here now. I miss him so much.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I know, Mom. He was as much a friend to me as he was a
dad&quot; She thought back fondly over her father's many passions and how she'd
shared a lot of them with him. One had been the nineteenth&#8209;century
Romantic poets, particularly Wordsworth and Shelley. Then he'd had his
astronomy period and they'd spent a lot of time together at the planetarium.
But he took an interest in her passions as well. When at age eight she decided
to collect coins, he went to the bank and brought back rolls and rolls of dimes
and nickels for her to go through. And during the summertime he'd take her and
Grant on the LIRR to </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Long
  Beach</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, every other
Sunday, all summer long.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was why the pain, the personal loss, of his horrible
death had never fully subsided. Perhaps it never would. But the difference
between them was that he had finally lost his will to live, whereas Ally found
her own will growing all the more with every new adversity she faced. The
weaker her heart got, the more determined she was to exercise, whatever it took,
to make it strong again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He would be so proud of the way you pulled CitiSpace
back from the brink.&quot; She let a tear slide down her left cheek, smearing
her makeup. &quot;And I'll tell you something else, young lady. You take after
us both when it comes to guts. My memory may be slipping, but I remember you
were always willing to take chances. And I guess that's what we're doing here
now. Both of us. We're gambling on life. In your case, you've got a lot to
lose.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally looked at her. Nina was having one of her moments of
incredible lucidity, but how did she know so much about what was really going
on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mom, did the doctor tell you what I—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The head nurse, Ellen, told me that you're going to
undergo a procedure for your heart. That you're going to start today.&quot; Her
eyes darkened. &quot;She also admitted he'd never used the procedure on a
condition like yours. It's completely experimental.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You talked to her this morning?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She took me downstairs, where they did my hair. She
said Dr. Vee thinks it's important for everyone here to have a positive
attitude. They ask you what you’d like and then they try to do it. Now I'm
ready for whatever comes next.&quot; She stared directly into Ally's eyes.
&quot;But that doesn't mean I still can't be nervous about all this untried
stuff.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mom, don't worry about me. I'm going to get through
this. If you'll be strong for me, I promise I'll be strong for you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She got up and walked to the window. From this vantage she
could just see the lake down through the trees. They were starting to put out
leaves, but it was still early spring and nippy here, so they mostly had just
buds. All the same, there was a sense of renewal about them, which made her
think of her own body.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Life is so bittersweet.&quot; Nina sighed. &quot;But
you still want to go on living, even when it's a daily struggle. Either I'm an
optimist or I'm pigheaded.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're just wonderful,&quot; Ally said. &quot;That's
what you are.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She glanced down at her watch. She was scheduled to meet
Ellen O'Hara downstairs at </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>ten
 forty&#8209;five</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, to
fill out the paperwork that formally entered her into the clinical trials. If
she decided to go ahead and enroll, this would be her last day of freedom.
Tomorrow she would have to begin the intense phase of the therapy. Did she
really want to do that? She wanted to talk to Van de Vliet one last time.
&quot;Look, Mom, I'm going to be downstairs for a while now, but I'll come back
up later.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All right. Ellen said there's a little library here
somewhere, so I may go down and look. I might even get something in Spanish, to
try and keep my mind alert.&quot; She sighed. &quot;Oh, Ally, I so want to be
the way I was again. Pray for me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally knew prayer wasn't something her mother engaged in a
lot. In fact, she'd always been a fervent agnostic. What had brought about the
change? Was it that she'd finally discovered that both her body and mind had
limits and wouldn't do what she wanted forever?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll pray for us both, Mom. But we're going to be okay.
I have faith.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Good for you.&quot; She looked away. &quot;I'll try to
have it too.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally walked over and kissed her, then turned and headed out
the door. Where was this all going to end? She had absolutely no idea. But with
Nina's miracle change overnight, the concern she'd heard in the voice of Stone
Aimes seemed a million miles away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As she walked down the marble stairs, she tried to take the
measure of the place. The Dorian Institute did inspire you with its look of
utter perfection. It was an appropriate setting for miracles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When she got to the lobby, she saw Ellen stepping off the
elevator, coming up from the basement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All set to get going?&quot; she asked, walking over.
&quot;Before we start any procedures, anything at all, we've got to fill out
the forms for the NIH. Technically, what is going on here is a clinical trial,
a very detailed study in which we constantly monitor the patients and try to
measure their progress objectively. So we'll have to take some time and
establish a very thorough baseline. We began that yesterday when you went to
the clinic in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New York</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> for a stress test. Among other
things, we'll be running an EKG on you here on a daily basis.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And all this goes into my NIH files?&quot; Ally asked.
They were getting on the elevator to go down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not the raw data. It's our job to structure our
patients' files in ways that will permit the NIH monitor, or other third
parties, to assess our results quickly.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They were getting off now, entering the starkly lit hallway
that connected the laboratory and Dr. Van de Vliet's office with the
examination rooms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Dr. Vee is working in the lab this morning, so we can
use his office to fill out all the forms.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally could see Dr. Van de Vliet and three other people,
members of his research team, all dressed in white, clustered around a
blackboard, where he was drawing some kind of flowchart. Again she was struck
by his youthful appearance. He surely did not look a day older than forty, or
forty&#8209;five tops.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This was the first time she had been in his office, and she
paused to look around. As was usual, he had a wall of framed diplomas and
certificates. From her cursory checkout, they seemed to correspond to the
educational history she remembered from his CV. It was a spacious room, with an
executive feeling, and he had an expensive fiat&#8209;screen nineteen&#8209;inch
monitor sitting on the left&#8209;hand side of his desk. Next to it was a
wooden table and chairs. A pile of NIH forms was there, along with a green <i>raku
</i>mug, filled with ballpoint pens.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He likes to let people use his office whenever
possible,&quot; Ellen explained. &quot;It's a lot less institutional than the
conference room.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Ally settled at the table and picked up the form.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;They want a lot of personal information,&quot; Ellen
went on, &quot;but your mother and I filled out her items yesterday and it
wasn't too hard. Needless to say, all personal information is completely
confidential. Even your name. After the first week, we only identify you with a
coding system.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Ally was reaching for a pen, a petite blond woman with a
smashing figure strode through the door. She was wearing a lab coat, not a
nurse's uniform, but it still showed off her curves. She was carrying a
stainless&#8209;steel tray containing a hypodermic needle and three glass
vials.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hi,&quot; she said with a smile, &quot;I'm Dr.
Connolly. Welcome to the Dorian Institute. We're all very excited about having
you here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Deb, come in,&quot; Ellen said seeming slightly
startled &quot;Is there something we forgot to—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, I just need to take one hundred fifty milliliters
of blood. We've got to get started on the cultures we'll be using</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>ASAP.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hang on a second&quot; Ally said. &quot;I was hoping to
talk this over a bit more with Dr. Van de Vliet before I take the final
leap.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're free to dither as much as you like,&quot; Dr.
Debra</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Connolly
said, her smile vanishing, &quot;but our programs are on a schedule.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'd still—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll just be taking a small amount of blood. We can
then get started on the cultures while you talk.&quot; She was already swabbing
Ally's arm and feeling for a vein. &quot;Now make a fist.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally hated giving blood and to distract herself she glanced
around the office, trying to construct a life story for Dr. Karl Van de Vliet.
Then she noticed a photo of him and a woman standing together on a bridge, next
to a sign that said </span><span style='text-transform:uppercase'><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Charles river</span></span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, which meant </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Boston</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, and they were holding hands and
smiling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The odd thing was, the cars behind them were models at least
fifteen years old, yet he looked just the same as he did today.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Whoa. There it is again. That odd age thing. There is
something very strange about this man. She finally got up her courage to ask.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Dr. Connolly, do you know how old Dr. Van de Vliet is?
He looks so young.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There are some things it's not polite to ask.&quot; She
was capping off the vial and reaching for a second. Her voice had grown
genuinely frosty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Frankly, I don't see why. He knows everything there is
to know about me. He has all my files.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You could ask at the front desk for one of our
brochures. I'm sure it would clear up any questions you have.&quot; She
attached the second vial to the needle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've seen it. I know when he went to school and all
that. But still—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If you really want to know personal things, you might
just ask him yourself. You two seem to get along so well.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What is with her? Ally puzzled. Why is she being so hostile
and negative? And why that little jab about &quot;getting along&quot;? The
truth was, Debra Connolly could have been a runway model, but in a lab coat her
blondness and figure just intensified her bitchiness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Okay, maybe the question about his age wasn't overly
relevant, more a matter of idle curiosity. But how did he do it? Every woman
alive would like to know. Maybe the story Grant had told about Van de Vliet and
his experimental skin treatment was actually true. She hadn't put much stock in
it at the time, but seeing him out here in the flesh . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There's actually something else I was curious about.
Was a patient dropped from the trials a few months back? I was wondering if you
could tell me anything about that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What have you heard that would make you ask such a
question?&quot; Debra Connolly's face went blank, but her blue eyes registered
alarm. &quot;No one here is allowed to discuss specific cases. That would be a
violation of NIH rules and highly unethical. What made you ask that
question?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hey, why so defensive? Could it be Stone is on to something
that needs more daylight?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I did a little research on the Gerex Corporation and .
. .&quot; Then she had an inspired hunch. &quot;You know, the NIH has a Web
site where they post all the clinical trials they have under way.&quot; This
was actually something she knew to be true. She had used the site to look up
information about possible clinical trials for Alzheimer's patients that might
accept her mother. But she never could find any in the </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New York</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> area that seemed to offer any hope.
&quot;So naturally, your study was there. I like to know as much as I can about
what I'm getting into.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've been to that Web site many times. The public part
doesn't include—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So, has a patient ever been terminated?&quot; Ally cut
her off, hoping to avoid being caught in a lie. &quot;If so, I'd really like to
know why.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No one is allowed to discuss any details of the
clinical studies.&quot; She was capping off the last vial of blood the three
cylinders of red against the steel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think I'm going to have a talk with Dr. Van de Vliet
before I go any further with this program,&quot; Ally said feeling her temper
and her warning instincts both ratchet up. &quot;I feel like I'm being
stonewalled.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're free to think what you like.&quot; Debra
Connolly had turned and was brusquely heading for the doorway when it was
blocked by another blonde this one in her late fifties, who was standing in the
threshold and brandishing a black automatic pistol. Her eyes were wild. The
security guard from the entrance and the nurse from the front desk upstairs
were both cowering behind her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Where's Kristen?&quot; she demanded. &quot;Where's my
daughter? I know she's alive, goddam you. I've come to take her home.&quot;</span></p>

color:windowtext'>&quot;Who are you and how did you get in here?&quot; Debra
Connolly demanded backing away from the door and quickly settling her steel
tray onto a table. Ally got the instant impression that Deb knew exactly who
she was.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The woman's hair was an ash blond tint above dark roots and
was clipped short in a curt style. Her troubled face had stress lines, and her
heavy makeup reminded Ally of a younger Sylvia Miles or perhaps a particularly
intense real estate agent, except that real estate agents don't charge in on
you brandishing a Beretta.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's all been a lie,&quot; the woman declared her
cigarette&#8209;fogged voice shrill. If she recognized Debra, it wasn't
apparent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ellen hit a button on the desk and spoke into the intercom.
&quot;Dr. Vee, could you please come to your office immediately. It's an
emergency. There's someone here who—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're damned right it's an emergency,&quot; the woman
barked at her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hadn't you better give me the gun?&quot; Debra asked,
holding out her hand and stepping toward her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The woman turned and trained the pistol on her. &quot;Just
back off, sister. And keep out of this. I know you work for him but you're just
a flunky.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then could you at least keep your voice down,&quot;
Debra Connolly said, her composure hard as ice. The jab had bounced right off.
Underneath the beauty pageant exterior she was all steel and sinew. &quot;There
are patients upstairs....&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The hapless security man who'd been trailing behind the woman
had gone over to the positive&#8209;pressure door of the laboratory and was
desperately banging on the glass and waving for Dr. Van de Vliet. A moment
later, he strode out, still wearing his white lab jacket.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You,&quot; the woman hissed, turning to meet him.
&quot;You're the one who has her. You and that bastard Bartlett.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Madam, I must ask you to leave,&quot; he said warily as
he came up to her. &quot;Immediately.&quot; He glanced down at the pistol.
&quot;Otherwise I'll have to call the police.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Although he was giving the impression that the woman was just
an anonymous annoyance, Ally was sure she caught a glimmer of recognition, and
a patina of poorly disguised panic, in his eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I want to see Kristen, damn you. I want to know what
you've done with her. To her. You and that bastard Winston Bartlett who got her
into—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Kristen?&quot; He seemed puzzled. Then he appeared to
remember. &quot;There was a patient here briefly a while back, who I believe
was named—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Kristen Starr. That's right, you fucker. And you damned
well do remember her. And me. She's my daughter. Where is she?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My God, Ally thought, could she mean that Kristen Starr, the
one who had an interview show on cable. The world around this institute just
keeps getting smaller.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally had actually done an interior&#8209;design project for
Kristen</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Starr back
when she was first getting up to speed at CitiSpace. It was one of her first
jobs. At that time Kristen had just signed a two&#8209;year contract with E!
and she wanted to renovate her co&#8209;op in </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Chelsea</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>. But then just as the job was completed, she sold the place
and moved to a brownstone in the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>West</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
 </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Village</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, or so she'd said. Ally didn't know
why she had done it or where precisely she had moved to, but she got the
impression some very rich new sugar daddy was setting her up and he wanted the
privacy of a town house.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Could it be that Kristen was the mysterious missing patient
Stone was trying to locate and interview? Ally hadn't seen her on TV for a
while, so maybe she had moved on to other things.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I really don't know where she is now,&quot; Van de
Vliet said. &quot;She became emotionally unstable in the middle of her
treatment. It's a rarity but it has happened. She checked out. After that, I
don't—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's a damned lie,&quot; the woman declared. &quot;I
know it now. That's what your receptionists have been telling everybody. It
sounded a little like her at first, but now I realize it's preposterous. She
didn't just up and run off. You're keeping her somewhere. Where is she? Where's
my only child?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Wherever she is, I can assure you she's most assuredly
not here,&quot; Van de Vliet intoned smoothly, even as his eyes struggled to
stay calm. &quot;Would that she were. She wanted... a procedure done and I
think we were having some success. But then she became traumatized for some
reason best known to her and insisted on leaving. No one is forced to complete
the regimen here against their will. As best I recall, someone said she went to
a spa in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New Mexico</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I know that's what your flunkies have been telling me
over the phone. That she went to </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>New Mexico</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
to hide out. But now I know everybody lied to me. For the last three years
she's been sleeping with that bastard Winston Bartlett, but now his office
won't even return my phone calls. You all think you're so smart, but I could
smuggle a gun past your guards. In my bra!&quot; Her eyes had acquired a
further kind of wildness now as she awkwardly began opening her purse, hanging
from a shoulder strap, with her left hand while still holding the pistol in her
right. &quot;And I got a letter from her just this morning. The postmark is </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New York City</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. So—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What—&quot; Van de Vliet's eyes began to blink rapidly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She's not in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>New Mexico</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
now. If she ever was.&quot; The woman waved a small tan envelope at him. There
was large, loopy writing on the outside.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Could . . . could I see that?&quot; He started to reach
for it, but she waved the black Beretta at him and shoved the letter back into
her purse.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No you can't. What you <i>can </i>do is tell me where
the hell you're keeping her. Now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Before we proceed any further, that gun really isn't
necessary,&quot; Van de Vliet said as he reached and deftly seized her wrist.
He was quick, and his quickness seemed to spook her, because just as he turned
the pistol away, it discharged.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The round went astray, ricocheting off a metal lighting
fixture at the end of the hallway and into the wall. The hapless, unarmed guard
who'd followed her downstairs yelled and dived behind a large potted corn plant
near the office door. Both Ellen O'Hara and Debra Connolly just stared,
momentarily too stunned to move.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally stepped toward the woman, wanting to help Van de Vliet
disarm her. She was feeling her heart race dangerously upward.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Van de Vliet was still struggling with the woman when the
Beretta discharged again. This time it was aimed downward, at the hard tile
floor, and the ricochet was not so harmless. The round bounced back and caught
the woman in the chest knocking her sideways. Van de Vliet unsuccessfully
grabbed for her as she crumpled. Ally reached for her too, but by that time she
was already on the floor. Ally pulled the hot pistol from her fingers, then
turned and handed it to Ellen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Here. For God's sake, do something with this.&quot; She
realized she had never actually held a real pistol before.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Blood was flowing across the floor as Van de Vliet and Debra
Connolly began tearing open the woman's blouse. The bullet appeared to have
entered her chest just below the rib cage, a jagged wound caused by the
projectile's tumble and splattered shape, and then exited a few inches away, at
her side. She had passed out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Get a gurney now,&quot; he yelled to Ellen. &quot;We've
got to get her into OR one and try to do something about the bleeding.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My God, Ally marveled what desperation drove her to threaten
him with a gun when she obviously didn't know the first thing about how to use
it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The woman's open purse was lying no more than two feet from
where she had fallen. With the hallway rapidly filling as nurses from upstairs
poured off the elevator, no one was paying any attention to anything but the
prostrate woman.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Get the letter, Ally!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She gingerly moved over to where the purse was resting and peeked
in. There was a jumble of the usual things: cosmetics, a ballpoint, a change
purse, an address book, and a billfold. There also was the tan envelope. Yes!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The scene in the hallway was increasingly chaotic. Two of the
researchers from the laboratory had come out, in their sterile whites, with
disinfectant and a roll of bandages. As they began to bind her wound to stanch
the bleeding, her eyelids fluttered and she groaned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She's just in shock,&quot; Van de Vliet said with
relief. &quot;Ellen, page Michael and tell him to bring the ambulance around
front. Just in case. But I think we can handle this here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now two nurses were rolling a gurney off the elevator. While
Van de Vliet and the two lab researchers lifted her onto it, Ally realized that
nobody seemed to think that calling the police—about any of this—would be a
constructive step.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She pulled out the letter and examined it. The oversize
script on the front read Katherine Starr, </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>169 East 81st St.</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'> There was no return address.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Katherine Starr. She was repeating the name and address,
trying to lodge them in her memory, while she was pulling the letter out of the
tan envelope.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was in the same rotund script as the address:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Dear Whoever You Are,</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I think you 're my mother but I'm not sure. Please help me. I
don't know where I am or what my name is. But I found a bracelet with Starr on
it and I looked in the phone book. Your name sounded kind of familiar. I think
I'm . . .</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;I'd better take that,&quot; Van de Vliet said,
lifting the letter out of Ally's hands. &quot;All her personal effects should
be kept with her.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Dr. Vee, OR one is open,&quot; Ellen was saying as she
marched down the hall toward them. &quot;Debra has the IV and oxygen
ready.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Good,&quot; he said, glancing at her for a second. As
he did, Ally reached into Katherine Starr's purse and palmed the small black
address book.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then Van de Vliet turned back to her. &quot;Let me see about
her bleeding and then I'll try to explain. I now remember this woman all too
well. It's all coming back like a bad dream I'd repressed. I pegged her as
schizophrenic the minute I saw her, when she came here and tried to talk her
daughter into leaving. She's paranoid and—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What was Kristen Starr here for?&quot; Ally asked.
&quot;I actually did an interior&#8209;design job for her a few years back and
she never mentioned any health issues.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Actually nothing,&quot; he declared quickly. &quot;She
was having an early midlife crisis. I gather she'd had some kind of television
program and her contract wasn't renewed. She'd decided it was because of her
appearance.&quot; He shrugged and gestured with empty palms, Iike,<i> How
absurd but that's the way some women are. </i>&quot;It turned out we had a . .
. mutual acquaintance who told her about the stem cell procedure here at the
institute. When he brought her in, I wasn't in a position to turn her
away.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That wouldn't be Winston Bartlett, by any chance?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He nodded. &quot;As a matter of fact. He writes the checks,
so he has a certain amount of influence around here. As it happened, I had
experimented with a procedure some years ago involving stem cells and the
epidermis. There seemed to be a regenerative effect. And I thought there was a
reasonable chance she might respond to it. Since we had clinical trials for
other stem cell procedures already under way, it was easy to fit her in. But I
had a lot more important things going on at the time than her cosmetic work, so
I didn't pay much attention to her. Then she abruptly left, and since then I've
had so much else happening, I just haven't thought about her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Was it not working? Is that why she left?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Some of the staff swore it was having results. The
truth is, I wasn't following her very closely. In my honest opinion, stem cell
technology shouldn't be used for cosmetic purposes. It borders on the
obscene.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Whoa, Ally thought, according to Grant, you &quot;experimented
&quot; with a procedure for the skin on yourself. And you've got the youthful&#8209;looking
skin to prove it. Let's not have the pot calling the kettle black here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But if it was working, then why did she decide to
stop?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This story sounds way too pat, she thought.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You'll have to ask someone closer to her. Maybe she
didn't think it was.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How about Winston Bartlett. I gather he's pretty
close.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, she's a touchy subject with him. Good luck.&quot;
Van de Vliet hesitated and his face flushed. &quot;But now I really have to get
in there. I'm responsible for whatever happens around here. Particularly
whatever bad that happens.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was heading down the hall.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;One last thing. If Kristen is here in </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New York</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>, then how could I contact her?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I have absolutely no idea,&quot; he said over his
shoulder. &quot;If her own mother couldn't find . . . Actually, you might check
with the front desk. All clinical trial participants are here under a
confidentiality agreement, which means that giving out any information about
her would be a liability issue, but now . . . See if they have a prior address
they can give you. After she left, it never occurred to me to pursue her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was going through a door marked OR 1, but then he revolved
back. There was a darkness in his eyes she hadn't seen before. &quot;I guess
I'm wondering why, exactly, you're so interested in this deranged girl. It has
no bearing whatsoever on your own treatment.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's just something I'm curious about.&quot; She
stopped, her emotions in a jumble. What is going on? &quot;You know, I'm
wondering if maybe we shouldn't start my procedure later in the week. All this
. . . guns and shooting . . . is a bit much for me to take in.&quot; She looked
at him. &quot;I guess I can't remember ever seeing anyone pull a pistol on
their doctor before.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I can understand your disquiet,&quot; he said, his eyes
dimming even more, &quot;but I'd really hoped we could get started today. I
should be free in an hour or so and we can—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've given the blood sample you wanted, but I've just
had the fright of my life. I want to go up and see Mom again and then I want a
day to recharge.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Get hold of Stone, she was thinking, and then try to find
Kristen. Something feels very non&#8209;kosher here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just be aware,&quot; he went on, &quot;that this
procedure can't wait forever. I told you that we have less than three weeks
left. At the end of the month, the clinical trials will be completed and this
facility could be temporarily closed because of corporate restructuring.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What is he talking about, &quot;corporate
restructuring&quot;? You 're pressuring me again, she thought. I really don't
like that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It can wait for a day.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All right. If you must. But that's it. We have to start
tomorrow. Seriously.&quot; He came back and reached and took her hand.
&quot;This means a lot to me, Alexa. I really want to help you. And I truly
think we can.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>With that, he turned and walked into the OR.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She stood watching for a moment, and when he was definitely
gone, she took the small black leather volume out of her waistband.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>On a hunch she opened it to the first page and... sure
enough, there it was, penciled in down one side: Kristy 555&#8209; 1224. No
last name and no address.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The rest of the book had only a dozen entries, so few that
Ally wondered why Katherine Starr bothered carrying it. Compulsive, maybe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She couldn't wait to get to her car and get on the phone to
Stone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Kristen Starr could well be the mystery patient he was
looking for. In any event, she was missing, freaked out, unsure who she was,
and probably in a lot of trouble.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But now they had a phone number.</span></p>

sounded like he'd just won the lottery. &quot;For the patient who was
'terminated'? My God, Ally, you're incredible.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Possibly. But what I know I am is very worried. For one
thing, if this is the person you're looking for, the one who got dropped from
the trials, it's somebody you've probably heard of, and for another, I've just
had a series of very disturbing experiences. . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

her </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Toyota</span><span

get away from the Dorian Institute fast enough.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After leaving Karl Van de Vliet, she'd taken the elevator up
to the second floor to check in on Nina.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What's all the excitement?&quot; her mother had asked.
&quot;One of the nurses just told me that a deranged woman with a gun barged
into the lobby looking for Dr. Vee. Then she shot herself.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>“It's nothing, Mom. Everything is all right now.&quot; She
hadn't wanted to upset Nina, but she was convinced Karl Van de Vliet had just
done some major lying. His uneasy body language told her he knew a lot more
about Kristen Starr than he was admitting; for that matter, Debra Connolly
probably did too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, thank goodness,&quot; Nina had said. &quot;Are
you going to start the procedure for your heart today?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not yet. I want another day to think about it. But tell
me how you're doing really. I mean, are you comfortable with how everything's
going here? You can still stop if things don't feel right.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally half wanted to get her out of the Dorian Institute
immediately. She didn't know what either of them had stumbled into. She just
knew now that, along with the possibility of miracles, the Dorian Institute had
a lot of questions that needed straight answers. She no longer trusted Karl Van
de Vliet. She had seen his facade crack momentarily and what lay beneath it
made her very uncomfortable.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Furthermore, she thought he realized she knew he was lying.
And it seemed to make him even more desperate to keep her there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ally, what a silly thing to say. Of course I want to
stay.&quot; She'd fluffed up her pillow and reached for the TV remote.
&quot;Some of the smoke has already been blown out of my mind. I'm feeling
clearer by the minute.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There's surely got to be some &quot;placebo effect&quot; at
work here, Ally thought. But still, she does seem more aware.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, Mom, I'm going back into the city now. But I'll
be here tomorrow and every day to check on you. Just don't . . . don't let them
do anything to you that seems strange.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>With that, she had given Nina a kiss on the forehead and
taken the marble stairs down to the first&#8209;floor reception.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was now time to find Kristen Starr.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The nurse at the desk was a woman named May Gooden. The main
floor had returned to normal after all the excitement, with patients passing
through as they came back from the cafeteria.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally had decided to try a long shot and see if she could pry
out any information about Kristen from the patient files. She asked point&#8209;blank.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I guess Dr. Van de Vliet was not aware of the legal
strictures in our NIH agreement,&quot; May had said. &quot;No personal
information can be released without a patient's signed authorization.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You do remember her being here, though? Kristen
Starr.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My Lord, that's not something that goes unnoticed. She
had an assumed name but everybody knew who she was. A nice girl. Nicer than
you'd expect from seeing her on television.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So when, exactly, did she leave? Surely you can tell me
that harmless piece of information? It was several months ago, right?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>May got a strange look in her eyes. &quot;Who told you
that?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I . . . I was downstairs when her mother showed up. I
just got the impression that it was—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>May glanced furtively around. &quot;I shouldn't be telling
you this, but the truth is, I think she was still here until just a few days
ago. She was down in intensive care. No nursing staff is allowed down there,
just those medical&#8209;research people he has working for him, what some of
the nurses call the Gang of Four. But they brought her up in the elevator and
then an ambulance took her away.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;When, precisely, was—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've said too much already.&quot; She glanced around
again. &quot;And I can assure you that Kristen didn't sign an authorization to
give out her personal information.&quot; She abruptly turned frosty and
officious, as though rethinking how open she'd just been. What was she afraid
of? &quot;Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got some things I need to do.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally had nodded and thanked her and split.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Thus the search had already produced an interesting factoid.
Karl Van de Vliet was most assuredly engaged in the practice of a big lie about
Kristen. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe you should start by telling me about the
disturbing experience,&quot; Stone was saying.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As the shadows of the trees that lined the leafy driveway
glided past the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Toyota</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>'s windshield she told him about
Katherine Starr and Kristen Starr. She also told him the disparate versions of
Kristen's departure as recounted by Van de Vliet and May Gooden.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sounds like they've got a situation,&quot; Stone
declared. &quot;They're trying to hide somebody who's well known. But you've
got a number?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Like I said I palmed Katherine's little black book and
it's got what could be the last known phone number for Kristen. Since she
probably left the institute in an ambulance a few days ago, I doubt if she's at
that number now, but it's someplace to start. I assume the area code is two&#8209;one&#8209;two.
There're reverse directories where you can find the address for a phone number,
right? In fact, I think there's a site on the Web that—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Leave that part to me. If the number's still good I'll
have it in five minutes. Then I'll call you back and maybe you could meet me
there, assuming it's somewhere in the city. Just give me your cell
number.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She did and then clicked off the handset.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My God, she thought, that's the first time I've &quot;given
my number &quot; to a man—not a business acquaintance—since Steve died. Okay,
there were dinners with a couple of bachelor clients that turned out to be more
than dinner. But neither relationship had lasted past a month. Both the men,
nice guys, had complained she wasn't there for them—she wasn't—and had broken it
off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She meditated on that as she went through the iron gates
(which opened automatically) and headed down the leafy, twisting roadway
leading to the expressway.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She also found herself wondering what Stone Aimes was really
like. There was an openness now that made her feel comfortable—though maybe
that was just his deceptive reporter's manner, his calculating way of getting
below her radar. He'd definitely picked up a few social skills over the past
years. God knows he needed them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Whatever was going on, it was good to have him around again.
There was something different about talking to him than talking to Jennifer,
though Ally wasn't quite sure what it was—and she was afraid to think too hard
about it. But whatever that difference, it was one of the million reasons she
so missed having Steve around.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Because if there ever was a time when she needed somebody to
talk to . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Why am I thinking all this? she chided herself. I'm trying to
psychoanalyze him and put him in a category when I don't know the first thing
about what he's actually turned into after all this time. Is all the warmth and
sincerity for real? Back in the old days he'd make nice whenever the stakes
were low, but then when he had something on the line, he'd push as hard as he
needed to get what he wanted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, she reminded herself, I'm that way too. That was part
of our problem.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The phone beeped.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Voila,&quot; Stone's voice announced. &quot;I got an
address in the </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>West</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Village</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>.
It's Two&#8209;Seventeen </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>West
  Eleventh Street</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. The
phone is unlisted but it's billed to her name, so you were right about the
number. And get this, it hadn't been turned off. So I thought, idiot, why don't
you do the obvious and just try calling?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But her mother said she'd disappeared. . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, that's highly plausible. There's an answering
machine there with a very strange message. It doesn't give a name, but it's a
woman's voice and it's like a <i>cri de coeur</i>. She's away but
she—quote—can't say where. You should listen to it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Greenwood Lake Road</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'> had now become </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Skyline Drive</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>for no
discernible reason, and the traffic was picking up. Ally put on some speed and
passed a truck.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll do that. But we don't actually know for sure if
it's the same Kristen Starr, though it surely has to be. Did you recognize her
voice?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've never watched her cable show. I just sort of know
who she is. But you'd better listen to her announcement. How could there be two
screwed&#8209;up young women named Kristen Starr in the same town, even if it
is </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New York</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll listen. It's got to be her, though. Give me the
address.&quot; She hesitated a moment after he did then, &quot;Would you like
to meet me there? I think I could probably make it in an hour, or an hour and a
quarter to be safe. We could ask around see if anybody in her building or the
neighborhood has any idea what's going on with her. Maybe somebody's seen
her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I was supposed to head into the office, but nothing
could keep me away,&quot; he declared with enthusiasm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A patrol car was speeding by in the opposite direction, siren
blaring. She waited for the noise to subside.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Great. I'll try for an hour. Unless the traffic really
gets crazy. You never know what to expect at the GW Bridge, even in the middle
of the day.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She clicked off the phone, then checked the number in the
front of the black address book and punched it in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The phone rang twice and then an answering machine started.
The voice making the announcement sounded thin, tiny, and fragile. Just hanging
on. It was the verbal equivalent of the loopy handwriting on the letter, a
transparent attempt to bolster nonexistent courage.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hi. I'm away for now—I can't say where—and I'm not sure
when I'll be back. But you can leave a message or whatever, in case I get a
chance to pick them up at some point. Or you don't have to. That's okay
too.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What an odd thing to say, Ally thought. It's like she s
trying not to sound too needful.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But it was definitely the Kristen Starr. The slightly ditzy
tone was right there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Next came a long series of beeps as the machine proceeded to
rewind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This is surreal, she thought. I'm about to leave a message
for a person who's God&#8209;knows&#8209;where.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>While the machine beeped, she tried to rehearse what
she wanted to say, to make it as non&#8209;threatening as possible. Finally the
machine stopped rewinding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Kristen, hi, my name is Ally Hampton. You may remember
I did an interior&#8209;design job for you when you lived in </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Chelsea</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. CitiSpace? I just met your mother.
She got your letter.&quot; Should I tell her about the gun accident? Ally
wondered. No, she's weirded&#8209;out enough already. &quot;Your real name is
Kristen Starr. You seemed a little confused about that in your letter to her,
which I read part of. You'd been at the Dorian Institute in </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New Jersey</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. Listen, it's really important to
me, and to your mother, that you get in touch. I'd like to help you if I can,
because from what I saw of your letter. . . Anyway, let me give you my cell
phone number. If you pick this up, you can call me anytime, night or day.
It's—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How did you get this number?&quot; a frightened voice
burst through. Ally recognized it, though it was nothing like the one she
remembered from the confident, brassy TV personality that Kristen used to be.
&quot;I just got away and came here. And right after I got here, someone called
my machine and then hung up. Are you tracking me? Who are you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I . . .&quot; Ally was so startled she couldn't think
of anything to say immediately. &quot;Kristen, is that you? I just saw your
mother. I. . . I got this number from her. She came out to the Dorian Institute
looking for you. She's very worried about—&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're lying to me. You're trying to trick me and get
me back.&quot; She was breathing heavily, as though she'd just run a set of
stairs. This is a person just barely holding it together, Ally thought.
&quot;Anyway, Kristen is not my name. My name is Kirby. They wrote it down for
me and ... I'm very confused. I found a bracelet in my suitcase that had
'Starr' on it. Maybe that's my last name. It sounds right, but I can't
remember—&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You don't remember having a show on cable?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'> &quot;I . . . I think I knew someone who had a TV show, but
I don't think it was me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Kirby . . . or whatever your . . . listen carefully. I
think you were undergoing an experimental procedure for your skin. At a place
in </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New Jersey</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> called the Dorian Institute. The
doctor was Karl Van de Vliet. You were in clinical trials for the National
Institutes of Health. Then something happened and you left. Do you remember why
you left? Or when?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No.&quot; She stifled a sob. &quot;I can't remember
anything.&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally took a deep breath, not liking the vibes she was
getting. &quot;Do you want to talk about it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No. I don't want to talk to you or to anybody. I got
out of that place and—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot; 'That place'?&quot; Ally asked. She was being passed
by a huge bus and she could barely hear. &quot;You mean the institute?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know where I mean. And don't come looking for me down
here either, because I'm not going to be here.&quot; Jesus, Ally thought,
what's with her? </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Kris—Kirby, I'm not connected with anybody at the
Dorian Institute. I'm supposed to become a patient there myself. I'm just
trying to find out what happened to you when you underwent your treatment
there.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I can only remember little things.&quot; She was
moaning. &quot;There was this man. He said I could have anything I wanted. I
trusted him. And now . . . I see faces but I can't remember who—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Kristen—that's your real name, by the way—can we meet?
I promise you won't be harmed. I just—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You don't understand do you? You don't know what's
happening to me.&quot; Her voice had begun to break. &quot;It's the Beta. I
don't know how long it's going to be before—&quot; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Before what? What beta? What are you—Kristen, we've</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>really got
to meet. I mean it. I desperately need to talk to you. Maybe we could find
another doctor, if that's what you need. Could I come down—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I have no idea who you are. You could be . . . He says
they're trying to help me, but I'm not getting any better.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally was pulling onto the interstate, heading south. It was
hard to concentrate on driving, but at the same time she wanted to push the
speed limit. Kristen sounded like she was getting ready to disintegrate or
flee.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then she had another thought.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Kristen, it's okay if you don't trust me. But could you
tell me more about your . . . side effects? Are they—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think that's why he moved me. To that place. But then
he ...&quot; She was growing even more agitated and impatient. &quot;Look, I
really can't talk anymore.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I'm losing her, Ally thought. Try to make her hang on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Kristen, would you please take my phone number? You
sound like you could use a friend.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Oh Christ, I'm so scared. I don't—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just take it. No harm. Then if something happens and
you want to—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All right,&quot; she said finally. 'Tell me and I'll
write it down.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally gave it to her, then added, &quot;I run an interior&#8209;design
firm. I actually did some work for you once, so we've met. You can call my
office, so let me give you that number too. No way am I connected to the
institute where you were.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She said she was writing it down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know,&quot; Kristen went on, &quot;I think this is
God's way of punishing me for wanting something nobody should have.&quot; Then
she began to sob again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How exactly—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I found a door that wasn't locked and I just came here.
I don't know what guided me. And when I got to this street, I knew exactly
which building it was. There was no name on my bell or anything, but I knew. I
even knew who had my emergency key. It's like I have a sense memory of this
apartment but I can't remember ever actually living here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your name is Kristen Starr,&quot; Ally said again.
&quot;Try to remember that. And will you please stay there till I can get there
and talk to you?&quot; Then she made what she immediately realized was a fatal
mistake. &quot;There's a reporter, a sweet guy who's doing a book about . . . a
medical procedure at the clinic where you were. And he's dying to talk to
anybody who's been part of the clinical trials there. Could he talk to you too?
It sounds like you've got quite a story to tell.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You've got to be kidding. If they find me, I don't know
what they'll do.&quot; And the connection was severed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Shit, don't do this.&quot; She quickly tried the cell
phone number for Stone Aimes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's me again. Listen, she's actually there. Kristen's
in the apartment on </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>West
  Eleventh Street</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. I
just got off the phone with her. She's the one you want. But she's like a
frightened rabbit. She said she was about to leave, but if you get there soon,
you might be able to catch her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Damn, we're stuck in traffic at </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Fifty&#8209;ninth Street</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. There was a fender bender on Lex.
But I'll get there as soon as I can.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, maybe get your driver to try Fifth.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Good idea.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She clicked off and stared at the road. The </span><span

 </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bridge</span><span

speed limit once she hit the West Side Highway, and caught the lights right,
she might even beat Stone there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;W.B., we've got a problem,&quot; Karl Van de Vliet said
into the microphone. He was in his private office, on the scrambled videophone.
&quot;Kristen's mother showed up just before </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>noon</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
with a pistol, demanding to know where she was. When I tried to take the gun
away from her, she accidentally shot herself through the side. Fortunately, it
was only a flesh wound, but it took us almost an hour to stabilize her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Christ! Even Kristy thinks she’s crazy. Why did
she—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Kristen smuggled her a letter somehow. And she came
looking for her.&quot; He thought about how they shouldn't be having this
conversation on any kind of phone, even one that was supposedly scrambled. But
there was no choice. &quot;It gets worse. I just called Eight&#8209;Eighty Park
and they checked her room and Kristen's not there. She was there when Roxanne
brought up her breakfast at nine, but nobody's seen her since. They assumed
she'd gone back to sleep. Nobody there has any idea where she went.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Shit. What am I paying them for? The staff is there for
the sole purpose of making sure something like this didn't happen.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, W.B., that's your part of the show. I'm just
trying to practice medicine. In any case, she slipped out somehow. So the thing
now is, where did she go?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, she didn't come here. Or at least she hasn't yet.
Depending on how much she can still remember, she might have gone to her old
place down in the Village. Maybe she still has a homing instinct. That's
probably the first location we ought to check. Jesus, if she gets recognized
and starts acting crazy and then Cambridge Pharmaceuticals finds out—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;W.B., the bigger problem now could be her mother,
Katherine. You know her. She's unbalanced but she also still remembers how it
all started. She was actually here a couple of times. If she sees Kristen, then
God help us.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Karl, I've got everything—and I do mean everything—
riding on this. What happened with that </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
  color:windowtext'>Hampton</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
woman? You've got to get started with her. Is she on board yet or what?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She was here this morning, but she got temporarily
spooked by the gun and the craziness. She'll be back, though.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;When?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I took care of it, trust me,&quot; Van de Vliet
declared. &quot;In the meantime, I'll try to maintain Kristen's mother under
sedation as long as possible. But we can't keep her out of touch forever. That
would be flirting with kidnapping.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll send Ken over to </span><span style='font-size:
  10.0pt;color:windowtext'>West Eleventh Street</span><span style='font-size:

get her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And he signed off, the image on the computer going dark.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Van de Vliet felt a wave of apprehension. Every day it got
worse. Would any of the other patients develop the Syndrome? Or was its
development unique to the Beta?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Kristen had agreed of her own free will to undergo the Beta,
and she'd been warned that any experimental procedure involved significant
risk. She'd signed release documents absolving Gerex of any liability. But when
treatments go awry, patients tend not to recall the releases they signed.
Undoubtedly, she'd now conveniently forgotten that fact. Assuming she still
remembered anything.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Time to go back to the OR and see how Katherine was doing. If
she seemed completely stabilized and coherent, she could be moved down to the
intensive&#8209;care area in the floor below, the subbasement. That way
absolutely nobody could get to her. He clicked off the computer and walked back
to the OR.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Karl, she's awake,&quot; </span><span style='font-size:
 10.0pt;color:windowtext'>David</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
said as he walked in. He'd been monitoring her. &quot;It's probably okay to
move her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Thank God, Van de Vliet thought. Maybe there's some way to
reason with her rationally. He moved over and looked down. Her hair was soaked
with sweat and she looked very, very tired.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mrs. Starr, can you understand me? I'm Dr. Van de
Vliet. I need to talk to you about your daughter, Kristen.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who . . . who are you?&quot; she mumbled, her eyes
trying to focus.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm Kristen's physician. She came to see me some months
back. Do you recall? About her . . . skin problem. I seem to remember you came
here with her at one point.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She stared at him mutely for a moment, then closed her eyes
and nodded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;At that time, Mrs. Starr, we discussed some radical
treatment options. Things that hadn't been tried before. Do you have any
recollection of that?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She opened her eyes again and stared at him, trying to focus.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You said she'd be all right,&quot; she mumbled,
slurring the words. &quot;Then your receptionist told me she'd gone to </span><span
  style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>New Mexico</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>. But I got a letter—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That story was to protect her professionally,&quot; he
lied. &quot;She was afraid the press might find out she was here and start
speculating about her health. But now she's in the post&#8209;procedure phase
of treatment. It may be a while longer before she's able to return to the
normal life she's used to.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She's okay, isn't she?&quot; came a plaintive, slurred
mumble. &quot;In her letter it sounded like she’d lost her memory or something.
She didn't sound right.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was a question that cut him to the core.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mrs. Starr, I think we should focus on you right now.
You've had a traumatic episode and you've injured yourself pretty seriously.
You may have to stay here at the institute for a few days so we can take care
of you.&quot; He took her hand which felt deathly cold. &quot;Tell me, is there
anyone we should notify of your whereabouts so they won't be alarmed?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There's an address book in my purse.&quot; Her eyelids
flickered. &quot;Those are all people I'm close to. I just want to sleep. I
can't think now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Good, he thought, the sedative is finally kicking in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All right. You need your rest. We'll talk about this
later.&quot; He turned and picked up the purse at the foot of the bed. But when
he searched inside, he didn't see an address book.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Where was it? he wondered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Alexa Hampton had started reading Kristen's letter, which
probably was part of the reason she got uneasy. Did she make off with the
address book? But why?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It didn't matter. She would be back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>If Debra had done what she was supposed to do.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>David</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> have Mrs. Starr taken downstairs. I
need to see Deb.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You've got it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Van de Vliet went down the hall and then through the heavy
steel air lock and into the laboratory.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Deb, can I have a word with you?&quot; He motioned for
her to follow him to the computer cubicle in the back, past the head&#8209;high
racks of solvent vials and the giant autoclave.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is she going to be okay?&quot; Debra asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think so. It's in her interest that we keep her here
and away from a hospital. Gunshot wounds raise a lot of questions. I seriously
doubt that that pistol was licensed in her name, given how little she seemed to
know about its operation.&quot; He settled into a chair and began stroking his
brow. &quot;Did you manage to take care of that matter with Alexa
Hampton?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She nodded. &quot;You know, she's not yet entirely with the
program.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, but she will be. Putting her mother in the
clinical trials was probably crucial.&quot; He grimaced. &quot;God, what a
nightmare. A medical experiment that got away from us has turned into guns and
virtual kidnapping and God knows what manner of felonies. If this thing gets
completely off the track, we could all go to prison. But the real tragedy is
that all the successful research we've done here will be buried in
infamy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's not going to turn out that way. The results here
have been so spectacular.&quot; She was gazing at him with eyes that seemed too
worshipful. More and more, she made him self&#8209;conscious. She needed a
father, but he did not need a daughter. He still lived on the memory of
Camille.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This has all got to be resolved soon, Deb. There's a
reporter who found out that we had to drop a patient from the program—which
would be Kristen—and W.B. thinks he's a little too close for comfort. Now
Kristen's mother shows up. It's all starting to unravel.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't worry,&quot; she said, getting up. &quot;This
Hampton woman is going to be back today. So I've got to get started on her
blood.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally was very fond of Kristen's West Village neighborhood,
since she herself had once had an apartment on West Eleventh Street, just west
of Seventh Avenue. The street was tree&#8209;lined and many of its nineteenth&#8209;century
town houses were home to single families, though sometimes the ground floor,
with the entry &quot;under the stoop,&quot; i.e., beneath the stairs, was rented
out to provide a little side income. She had rented one of those &quot;garden
apartments&quot;—the upstairs owners were two gay bankers—and had loved it.
However, it also was entirely possible that Kristen had the whole town house to
herself—that was the kind of thing that a lot of celebrities who lived, or even
just spent time, in New York did. There was privacy and there also was the
sense of living in an actual house instead of in some cookie&#8209;cutter
apartment. Then again she could have a downstairs neighbor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A solitary town house seemed somewhat at odds with the
extroverted personality Kristen displayed on TV, but the privacy was probably
intended more for her sugar daddy, Winston Bartlett, than for her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally had been pushing the pace ever since she got off the
phone with Stone. At Twenty&#8209;third Street she had peeled off the West Side
Highway and gone over to Seventh Avenue, where she had a straight shot
downtown. She passed St Vincent's Hospital, and the notorious six&#8209;way
intersection that caused so many accidents, and hung a right on West Eleventh.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was approaching the corner at Bleecker Street when a huge
black Lincoln Navigator lumbered in front of her, at an angle that cut her off
and blocked the street. Then the vehicle abruptly slammed to a halt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What—!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She hit her own brakes and managed to slide to a stop just
before she collided with the Lincoln's rear bumper. At first she thought they'd
deliberately cut her off, but then she realized the move had nothing to do with
her. A man and a woman were piling out. He was muscular and balding, with dark
hair and sunglasses, and he was dressed in black. She had red hair streaked
with white and was dressed in a nurse's whites. They were in a major hurry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was when she recognized the man she'd met at Gramercy Park,
the Japanese sidekick Bartlett had called Ken.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Oh shit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then she realized that a thirtyish woman was running down
West Eleventh Street toward them, carrying a dark green backpack in her left
hand. They were gesturing for her to come to them and get into the vehicle,
though she didn't appear to see them yet. Halfway down the block behind her, a
man in a tan flight jacket was running, calling out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Kristen, wait I just want to talk—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The running woman glanced over her shoulder at him and, at
that moment collided with Bartlett's flunky. As she recoiled from the impact
the red&#8209;haired woman seized her left arm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Kirby, come,&quot; the woman said. &quot;You're not
well. We'll take you back.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No!&quot; she yelled, and twisted free of the woman's
grasp. But now the Japanese guy had grabbed her other arm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's going to be all right,&quot; he said as he caught
the top of her head and started shoving her through the open door of the
Navigator. &quot;You shouldn't go out alone.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At that moment the man in the tan flight jacket reached the scene.
It was Stone, but he'd been moments too late.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He stretched his arm into the Lincoln and tried to take the
girl's hand. &quot;Kristen, don't go with them. I just need to talk—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You don't need to do anything, pal,&quot; the man
called Ken declared. &quot;Except get out of the way.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He chopped the side of Stone's neck with an open hand,
sending him sprawling backwards onto the pavement, flight jacket askew.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now something odd was going on. Another girl was running down
the sidewalk. &quot;Kristy, wait. Don't . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But the redheaded woman had already gotten into the backseat
of the SUV, beside the girl, and the Japanese man was heading around the front.
Three seconds later, he was behind the wheel and peeling out. They were gone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally sat watching, stunned. But now a Chevy sedan was
departing a parking space three cars down from where she was and she quickly
pulled in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>By then Stone Aimes had picked himself up off the sidewalk
and was gazing wistfully in the direction of the vanishing Lincoln. The girl
who'd been behind him stopped and was talking to him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally quickly locked the Toyota and went over.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But why did she run?&quot; Stone Aimes was asking. He
was disheveled but then being slugged and knocked to the sidewalk takes a toll
on anybody's poise.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She didn't know who you were,&quot; the girl replied
She looked like she would have been more at home in the East Village than here:
late twenties, tattoo on one bicep, eyebrows pierced blue jeans, hair needing a
better day. She had serious acne scars on her cheeks. &quot;I think she thought
you were them, whoever they were.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally looked Stone over and felt a surge of admiration. In
spite of the fact he just got decked, there was an athletic feeling about the
way he carried his body, as though he was ready to pounce on a news source.
Only he just didn't pounce quite fast enough this time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She walked up and gave him a hug. For a lot of reasons.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, we can't go on meeting like this.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My God, how humiliating.&quot; He winced.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What in heaven's name just happened? That was Kristen,
all right. But why was she running from you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I saw this woman walking very fast up the street
carrying a backpack and I just took a shot and called out 'Kristen.' She
glanced back at me, then took off like a rabbit. All I accomplished was to
drive her directly into the grasp of those goons.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You scared her,&quot; the girl with the pierced
eyebrows shouted, gazing angrily at Stone. &quot;Who are you? Why did
you—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm a newspaper reporter,&quot; he said. &quot;Who are
you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;I sublet the garden apartment from her. I met
her when I was doing her makeup at the E! channel. I mentioned I was looking
for a place and she said she liked me and wanted somebody she liked to be her
subtenant. The rent is really low. Then they canceled her show and she had a
mental meltdown and went to a spa somewhere to regroup. Or at least that's what
everybody at E! says.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So that's definitely Kristen Starr?&quot; Ally asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I hadn't seen her in over five months, not even to pay
the rent, and I couldn't believe it was her when she rang my bell and asked if
she could borrow my copy of her key. At first I almost didn't recognize her.
She looked . . . different somehow. The odd part was, I got the impression that
she didn't recognize me either, at least for a minute or two. When I asked her
if she wanted the rent, she just looked at me funny. A few minutes later, she
brought the key back and she had a half&#8209;open backpack stuffed with
clothes and papers. She seemed nervous and disoriented. I was going to try and
help her get a cab. But then you showed up.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, look, I had no idea I was going to freak her out
like that,&quot; Stone said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What's your name?&quot; Ally asked and then she
introduced herself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My named is Cindy Dobbs. And you know something?
Kristen didn't seem like the same person, in a lot of ways. She looked really
different. I don't know how to explain it. But something was really, really
wrong with her. And she kept saying her name wasn't Kristen, that it's
something else—I can't remember what now. All I know is, she was totally
spooked.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Talk about bad timing,&quot; Stone said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She was so paranoid she kept babbling about how 'they'
knew she was here in her apartment and were coming to get her and she had to
get away real quick. I don't know who she was talking about. Some guy used to
come by and his white stretch limo would be double&#8209;parked for a couple of
hours while he went in. But other than him, nobody ever came here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Cindy, the truth is, I was talking to her this very
morning on the phone,&quot; Ally said. &quot;I'm the one who called her. I also
met her mother today, who just got a crazy letter from her and was walking
around with a pistol because of it. I'm getting to be deeply invested in
Kristen Starr. Something bizarre seems to have happened to her and I need to
find out what it is.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally didn't want to confess that she felt indirectly
responsible for what had just occurred If she hadn't phoned . . . She stood
thinking a minute, then, &quot;Did you say you had a key to he</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>r place</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Cindy shrugged. &quot;I've had it since I moved in. We had
copies of each other's keys. Just in case, you know.&quot; She reached into her
ragged jeans and pulled it out and stared at it. It was attached to a blue
plastic tab,<span style='text-transform:uppercase'> Greenwich locksmiths.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then could we borrow it long enough to go in and take a
look around? Maybe we could find some clue to what's going on.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, if you want the key, and you think it can help you
find her, you can just have it.&quot; She was holding it out. &quot;I don't
want to go in there, ever. With my luck, those people would show up again and
take me away. But let me know if you find out anything, okay? I really thought
of her as a friend, even though we actually didn't know each other that well.
She didn't ever introduce me to that older guy who came around. Probably
because he was married, at least that's my guess.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think she knows those people who grabbed her just
now,&quot; Ally said, taking the key. &quot;Cindy, can we exchange phone
numbers?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sure. I meant it about letting me know if you find out
what's going on with her. Everybody at work is going to be really bummed when
they hear about this.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Moments later, Ally and Stone were alone on the street, with
Stone still appearing dazed. Now, taking measure of him in the daylight, she
noticed a bit more of the mileage in his face and body. Still, it was good
mileage and it had left him seasoned and lean. Also, she sensed that he really
cared about things. This was more like the man she remembered, a mensch in
wolf's clothing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Are you sure you're okay?&quot; she asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm going to be fine,&quot; he said. &quot;Jesus, I
never dreamed I'd spook her the way I did. By the way, did you get the license
number of that Lincoln? I sure as hell didn't.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I didn't need it. That guy is Winston Bartlett's
personal bodyguard. He called him Ken. I was at Bartlett's place on Gramercy
Park a couple of days ago and I saw him there.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're not kidding, are you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I wish.&quot; She paused. &quot;You know, Kristen and
Bartlett were being talked about as an item back when. 'Page Six.' &quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The Sentinel would never touch it, but that was more
than a rumor. Over the years I've had occasion to take more than a passing
interest in his affairs.&quot; He grinned. &quot;And for the past several days,
he's been taking a lot more interest in my affairs, ever since he found out
about the book.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Incidentally,&quot; she declared, &quot;I didn't have a
chance to tell you on the phone, but Kristen seems to have no memory of who she
is. Somebody told her that her name is Kirby, and that's what she insists on
being called. All in all, she sounded deeply screwed up.&quot; She dangled the
key. &quot;So why don't we go up and see if we can learn anything?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Did it seem odd to you that, what's her name, Cindy
didn't want to go in with us,&quot; he mused as they headed up the steps.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, maybe she's already seen it. God only knows what
we're going to find. Though the place she had in Chelsea was pretty well
maintained. After I redid it, it was a knockout, of course, but she'd already
moved down here by then.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The building dated from the middle of the nineteenth century
and the entryway, painted white, was a slight nod to the fashion for the Greek
Revival style that made its way into the New York town houses of that period.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She shoved the key into the new lock, a Medico, and pushed
open the door. Stone moved past her and switched on the light.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What awaited them was a minimally furnished but elegant living
room, with a small couch and table. The downstairs &quot;parlor floor&quot; had
been &quot;opened up&quot;; a lot of walls had been taken out and a staircase
was on one side of the front room. It felt like a modern loft.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Memorabilia from E! was all over, the logo on throw pillows
and two empty mugs on the table. The main decoration, however, consisted of
publicity photos of Kristen around the walls, a smiling blonde with flowing
tresses down over her shoulders. In all of them she was wearing heavy makeup
and the photos appeared to have been airbrushed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They were both trying to absorb what they were actually
seeing. Each photo, and there were at least sixteen, was pinned to the walls
with a steak knife, all with matching white bone handles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Jesus, who do you think did this?&quot; Stone asked.
&quot;Could it be that ditzy girl downstairs?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'd say she did it herself. Supposedly the reason she
went to the Dorian Institute was because she was having some kind of personal
crisis over starting to look older. She was consumed with terminal self&#8209;hate.
That's what this has to be about.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've never caught her on TV,&quot; Stone said, walking
over to study one of the photos, &quot;but from what little I saw of her on the
street just now, she sure seemed different from these head shots.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, this is exactly how she looked on the tube.&quot;
She told him the alleged story of how Kristen had ended up at the Dorian
Institute. Then she gazed around the room, still having trouble taking it in.
&quot;Jesus, this is really sick.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ally, I'm absolutely convinced that whatever happened
or didn't happen—keep that possibility in mind—to Kristen is connected somehow
to the reason Gerex's clinical trials have been put under ironclad
security.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Which is why, no matter what, they've got to get her
back on the reservation.&quot; Ally thought a moment. &quot;Van de Vliet told
me she'd left the clinic of her own accord. Which clearly was BS. Winston
Bartlett has her stashed somewhere. Probably in an apartment in one of the
buildings he owns.&quot; She looked over. &quot;What do you think it all
means?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How's this for a guess? Kristen is experiencing some
kind of side effect that's truly horrendous. Losing your memory is bad enough,
but there's probably something more too. I can't imagine what it is, but if the
truth about it ever gets out, their entire program of stem cell research would
be jeopardized.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, I don't see much here to help us find her,&quot;
she declared, looking around. &quot;The knives in the walls don't speak well
for her grip on sanity. Who knows? Maybe nothing's physically wrong with her. Maybe
it's just all in her crazy head. Look at this place, for goodness' sake. Except
for the knives, it looks pretty normal. Maybe she's just a nutcase and
imagining that her memory is going.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As she gazed around the room one last time, she noticed an
answering machine on the floor next to the couch. The message light on it was
blinking, and she walked over and pushed the play button. She remembered that
Stone had said he hadn't left a message, and Kristen had picked up when she
called her, short&#8209;circuiting the voice mail.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The phone machine announced in an electronic voice, &quot;You
have one message, at two&#8209;eleven<span style='text-transform:uppercase'>
p.m.&quot;</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then an unctuous male voice came on. &quot;Kirby, we know
you're there. You're still in treatment. You shouldn't be wandering around
unsupervised. It's a lot better, a lot safer, for you to stay with us now. This
is Ken. I'm coming with Delores to pick you up. I know you're upset, but you
shouldn't be. We're going to take care of you and help you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then the phone machine clicked off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My God&quot; Stone said glancing at his watch,
&quot;that's almost exactly when I got here. That's why she thought I was with
them.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's the guy who slugged you. I recognize his voice.
Guess they suspected she was here and that phone call was intended to flush her
out. It worked.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And I ended up right in the middle of it. Damn.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She walked around the empty room, checking it out. Except for
the head shots stabbed to the wall, there was not a scrap of paper to be seen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So how do we find Kristen without a clue? she wondered.
Should the kidnapping, if that's what it was, be reported to the police? But
what proof do we have that any of it actually happened? They're not going to
third&#8209;degree Winston Bartlett.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know,&quot; Stone said staring closely at one of
the photos, &quot;I didn't actually get a really good look at the woman running
down the street. She glanced back at me when I called out her name, but the
truth is, I'm not a hundred percent sure this is her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Come on,&quot; Ally said &quot;that had to be Kristen.
The girl downstairs recognized her. Though she did say she looked different
somehow.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're going to think I'm crazy,&quot; he went on,
still staring around at the walls, &quot;but it seems to me the girl on the
street was a lot younger than this one.&quot; He bit a fingernail
contemplatively. &quot;Christ, this is some sick material.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2>&quot;Stone, I'm going down to my office, to take
care of some things and think about this. Come along if you like. Maybe we've
overlooked something obvious. Something that—&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was when the beeper on his belt went off. He looked down
at the number.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Whoops. It's my managing editor.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Where you work?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Right. Only I've got a feeling this call could be about
how I used to work there.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ellen O'Hara, R.N., who was in charge of the nursing staff at
the Dorian Institute and chair of the union committee for the Gerex
Corporation, looked around the room, which was a conference space just off the
laboratory in the first level of the basement. Each of the three other nurses present
reported directly to her and they had filed in casually one by one, in order
not to draw the attention of the research staff as they passed the laboratory.
They all sensed the imminence of crisis and this was a clandestine emergency
meeting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The appearance of Katherine Starr and the shooting that
transpired had left the entire nursing staff in dismay. Of course they all
remembered Kristen Starr, the outgoing and scatterbrained TV personality, who
had arrived in the throes of a mental meltdown. Some also remembered her
mother, Katherine, who had made a nuisance of herself till she was refused
further admittance (on the orders, everyone suspected of the owner, Winston
Bartlett, who was widely reported to have a romantic relationship with the
girl).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They also suspected that something had started going terribly
wrong with Kristen's cosmetic procedure. After seeming okay, her behavior had
suddenly become erratic and she had been immediately whisked into intensive
care in the subbasement and quarantined before anybody on the regular nursing
staff could learn what the problem was. She was attended by the research team
he had brought from California, and the information officer at the registration
desk in the lobby, May Gooden, was instructed to say she had voluntarily left
the program. (Well, maybe she had, but she hadn't left the institute.) Then
less than a week ago, she was rolled out on a gurney and loaded into the
ambulance, which was driven by Winston Bartlett's Japanese thug, and taken God
knows where.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ellen had checked and was dismayed, though not entirely
surprised, to discover that none of this had been included in the weekly
clinical&#8209;trial reports being forwarded to the National Institutes of
Health. (Which in itself was a flagrant violation of procedural requirements.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And now this. Kristen's own mother showed up deranged and
carrying a pistol, looking for her. How much longer would it be before the NIH,
or the police, found out that something funny had gone on?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Right now the first thing to do was to get the three senior
nurses in the room to put a lid on the rumors. They were her lieutenants; it
was their job.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Elise Baker, single and sharp and acerbic, was in charge of
the second floor; Mary Hinds, a kindly mother of two, had responsibility for
the third floor, and May Gooden, the queen of communication skills, handled the
reception and oversaw the staff responsible for the dining room. All three were
in their forties and they reported to Ellen O'Hara, who reported to Karl Van de
Vliet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Elise, could you please close the door.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sure.&quot; She was getting up. &quot;Is this the
quorum? You don't want anybody else here?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We have to decide what to do about Katherine
Starr,&quot; Ellen began. &quot;In my opinion, the absolute first thing we have
to do is make sure the story of what just happened never leaves this
building.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, I think Dr. Vee should call the police and have
her arrested&quot; Elise said as she quietly shut the door. &quot;The very
idea. Barging in here with a loaded gun.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't feel safe in the lobby anymore,&quot; May
Gooden declared. Her face was lined and she had streaks of premature gray.
&quot;We're all exposed out here in the middle of nowhere. I think Charles
should have a pistol. What good is it having a 'security guard' if you're still
not secure.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mary, what do you think?&quot; Ellen asked. She knew
Mary would always try to split the difference and reconcile differing opinions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't know. Maybe it was just the case of one crazy
person. It's probably not going to happen again.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Okay, Ellen thought, that's three different votes. Call the
cops, beef up security, or put our collective heads in the sand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She worried about the others, but she was also worried about
her own situation. Her husband Harold left her eight years ago for a younger
woman, and after reclaiming her maiden name, she'd raised their two young sons
on her own. Now the oldest, Eric, was ready to start college and she had no
idea how she was going to pay for it if she lost this job.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Gerex Corporation paid her almost twice what she would be
earning as an R.N. at an ordinary hospital. With her current salary, she had a
shot at providing the boys with an education. Without it—if Gerex got embroiled
in some horrible scandal and was put out of business—she had no hope
whatsoever.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Even worse, she might be named as being complicit in some
unethical shenanigans, knowingly putting a patient at risk in a human trial.
That would certainly drive a stake into the heart of her nursing career.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Elise, we'd better think long and hard about bringing
in the police. They would talk to Katherine and she'd tell them Kristen was
missing and we simply have no idea where it would end.&quot; She paused.
&quot;I'm about to say something I shouldn't, but I guess this is the moment.
You all deserve to know an important fact. The NIH has not been told the reason
Kristen Starr was terminated from the stem cell program.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How do you know that?&quot; Elise asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I just checked the reporting records. Call it a hunch.
We all know that, for a formal clinical trial, that's a flagrant violation of
NIH rules.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What are you saying?&quot; Mary asked, her voice
filling with alarm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm saying we have no choice but to keep this whole
matter of Kristen and her mother under cover. If the Dorian Institute gets
caught tampering with the data from a clinical trial, it could be the end of
everybody's career. Dr. Van de Vliet's certainly, but most probably ours as
well.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My God,&quot; Elise blurted out &quot;Did we have to
wait till some crazy person with a gun barged in here before you got around to
telling us that clinical&#8209;trial data had been fiddled with?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe Dr. Vee still intends to provide a full report to
the NIH. Whatever he intends, if this whole matter blows up, the less any of us
knows about what may have gone on, the better.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well,&quot; Elise declared, &quot;I think they all should
be confronted. The clinical trials aren't over yet. There'll be a final report
so he can still give the NIH whatever data had been left out. We should
confront him and demand that he give a full accounting in the final report
Otherwise we all could end up being part of some conspiracy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe we ought to think this over for a few days before
we do anything drastic,&quot; Mary said. &quot;We don't know what he intends to
do and there's still time. If we start giving Dr. Vee ultimatums, it's just
going to upset him even more. He could have been killed taking the gun away
from her. He's got enough to worry about just now. Maybe he's going to handle
her special case some other way that we don't know about.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My concern right now,&quot; Ellen said, &quot;is the
people who work under us. I don't think pulling an ostrich number is going to
protect anybody. We've got to get out of denial and face up to how serious this
might get. And I'll tell you our number one priority right now. If Katherine
Starr walks out of here before the Kristen problem is cleared up and gets the
ear of someone in the media, then everybody who works here . . . Let's just say
we mustn't allow that to happen. That's why we're having this meeting.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Are you suggesting we should keep her . . .
sedated?&quot; Mary asked. &quot;All her medications have to be approved
by—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No sedative should be listed on her chart and I'm not
telling you what to do, but use your imagination.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There was a moment of silence as the implications of the
unspoken order settled in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And starting immediately, we need to hold a meeting of
the staff on each floor and impress on them that the story of Katherine Starr
must never leave this building. Ever. Remind everybody that that would be a
serious violation of a staffer's original security agreement and would subject
them to legal action the likes of which they can't even begin to imagine. And
if somebody comes around asking questions about Kristen Starr, nobody here
knows anything. We can say she was here because that's part of the record and
she is no longer here. End of statement. Beyond that, nobody knows zip.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This problem is far from over, Ellen told herself. God only
knows how it's going to end.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Stone Aimes stepped off the elevator on the sixth floor,
his mind was running through his options. This phone call had to be about
Winston Bartlett. He was going to step up the pressure. First there was the
hellfire meeting in Jane's office, and now he'd seen a kidnapping. Maybe this
was about that. Was Jane going to pass along a threat of legal action if that
crime got reported?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The managing editor, Jay, had left a message with the third&#8209;floor
receptionist, Rhonda, to be forwarded to Stone. Gist: he was urgently required
in the office of their corporate counsel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What does this tell me? he wondered. That they're going to
try to do something to me that could have legal ramifications?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No, more likely it means that I'm going to be given an
ultimatum, maybe an injunction. And Jane gets to deliver it with all the legal
trimmings.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Still, he was determined to go on. &quot;You shall know the
truth, and the truth shall make you jive.&quot; Right? Well, not necessarily.
But at the least, the truth could make a hell of a book. And with that came
financial freedom, at least for a while. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The hallway felt desolate and ominous as he walked through
the doorway that opened onto the cubicles. Jane Tully was down on the third
floor, but he wanted to stop by his desk first and see if there’d been any
further communications from Winston Bartlett. Possibly there still could be a
deal in the making</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The room itself was silent, no one meeting his eye. Maybe, he
thought, it's the middle of the afternoon and everybody's dozing off from a
late lunch. But when he got to his cubicle, he realized why he had suddenly
become invisible. The top of his desk was bare, and there were three large
cardboard boxes sitting on the gray carpet next to it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think I get the picture,&quot; he said to the empty
space.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It looked like Winston Bartlett had just provided him with a
career decision. For a moment he felt his life passing before his eyes, but
then all he could think about was the future. This was not just the end of a
wage&#8209;slave era; it was the beginning of the next phase of his life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He saw everyone still avoiding his eyes as he turned around
and walked back to the elevator. How much did Jane know about this? She had to
know everything, which was why Jay sent him to see her. She would have no
qualms about giving someone the ax, including a former lover.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When he stepped off the elevator on the third floor, Rhonda
looked at him as though he were a corpse.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She's—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I know she's here. Don't bother buzzing her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He strode purposefully down the hallway, realizing it was
probably the last time he'd ever walk it, and pushed open Jane's door. She was
on the phone and looked up startled putting her hand over the mouthpiece.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just came to say farewell. Jay told me to come see you.
I</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>guess he was
sure you'd want to be part of this important life moment.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Stone, for God's sake&quot;—she turned back to the
phone—&quot;let me . . . I'll call you tomorrow.&quot; She slammed down the
receiver. &quot;You have to know I had nothing to do with this. Bartlett got to
the Family. I think it was one of those noblesse oblige kind of things. Old
Money meets New Money and needs to placate it. The Sentinel is only marginally
a profit&#8209;making enterprise and the last thing they need is a lot of shit
from their landlord. He wanted you gone. And since your job was a small price
for them to pay to ensure domestic tranquility, do the math. Sorry, but that's
how it had to be. For God's sake, Stone, why did you drive him to this?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The ironic thing was, she was managing to look vaguely
contrite—tugging at a lock of short hair. He wasn't sure how she had the brass.
Apologies from the executioner are traditionally a tough sell.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let me tell you something, Jane. I already know more
about Winston Bartlett than he wants. He had somebody kidnapped today before my
very eyes. I even got slugged trying to stop it. So you can tell his lawyers to
tell him he'd better back off. The people who did it were recognized and they
work for him. If he wants to play tough, I could have a heartfelt exchange with
somebody I know very well at the Sixth Precinct, and also with the tabloids,
where I know a shitload of hungry columnists. Winston Bartlett could get real
famous, real fast&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Stone, you brought this on yourself. I tried to warn
you, but you're hell&#8209;bent on your own destruction. You're your own worst
enemy.&quot; She picked up her Blackberry and switched it off and sighed.
&quot;You never listened to me before and I don't expect you to do it now, but
take some free advice anyway: try not to piss off important people. It is
frequently a negative career move.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Jane, you know John Kennedy once said, 'Sometimes party
loyalty asks too much,' and I think that moment for me, is</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>now. From
here on, I'm going to be doing what I need to do, not what Bartlett or Jay or
whoever tells me to do. I guess that includes you too. There comes a time when
I have to do what's in my heart.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was finally focusing, looking at him strangely.
&quot;Stone, what did you just say? Bartlett had somebody kidnapped? Today?
What on earth are you talking about?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Did I secure your vagrant attention? Good. Actually, it
was less than an hour ago. There's no point in going into details, but I'm
pretty sure she was the patient terminated from the clinical trials at the
Dorian Institute that I had you ask Bartlett's lawyers about. I think there's
the possibility that something really weird began happening to her out there in
New Jersey. But I didn't get a chance to talk to her because they grabbed her
and took off.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, what do you think happened to her out
there?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The only thing I've heard and that's secondhand is that
she lost some part of her memory. She's even having trouble remembering her
name.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How do you know all this?&quot; she asked staring at
him. &quot;Were you—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I . . . know somebody who talked with her this morning.
Just a few short exchanges on the phone. That's all I can tell you. They're
doing something very powerful there at the institute, but in her case it seems
to have gone horribly wrong. That's my best guess. So they dropped her from the
clinical trials and gave her a new identity and stashed her someplace
incommunicado. But she got away for a couple of hours, somehow, and managed to
go back to her old apartment. In her case, it's a Village town house. But
Bartlett nabbed her back.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If you really believe all that, Stone, shouldn't you be
worried for your own safety?&quot; It was clear she was finally taking him
seriously.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Bartlett got me fired. That's probably enough for now.
I don't know enough to be a threat to him. Yet.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But what if you find out . . . whatever it is you're
looking for? Then—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then I'll know if medical miracles sometimes come with
a strange price.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was looking at him, pity entering her dark eyes.
&quot;What are you going to do for money? The child support you send to
Amy?&quot; She hesitated. &quot;I'm so sorry about this, Stone. If you need a
little help for the short term, I could—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't go there. I can take cash out on a couple of
credit cards. And when I turn in the manuscript for the book, I'll get the
other two&#8209;thirds of the advance. After that, I'm hoping I might get an
actual career.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Oh, Stone, I'm really sorry about this,&quot; she said
with feeling. &quot;Truly I am. I. . . I guess I still enjoy seeing you. Having
you around. You're a mensch, you know that? Whatever your other failings, and
God knows they're plenty, you were always kind. You're even kind to people who
don't necessarily wish you well.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, tell that to Amy if you ever get the chance.
Sometimes she thinks her dad is the meanest guy alive. Particularly when I
don't honor her every whim.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're a good father too.&quot; She sighed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>For Stone, this was always the moment that he wanted her
back—when she let her guard down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Dammit, Stone, why couldn't we make a go of it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We stopped having fun, Jane. That's all that happened.
I started to bore you. Back then I didn't provide enough excitement, enough
Sturm und Drang in your life.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You weren't dull, Stone, but sometimes you could be
maddeningly smug.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That may be about to change. Now that I'm an unemployed
freelancer. And I just ran into a blast from the past. Who knows what my life
is about to be like?&quot; He turned to leave. &quot;By the way, give my best
to Jay. Hopefully, he'll be the last managing editor I'll ever have to suck up
to.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>“Take care, Stone.&quot; She was getting up. &quot;You can
fight</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>this, you
know. They had me write up some kind of bullshit breach&#8209;of&#8209;contract
brief, in case you wouldn't go quietly. But it's full of holes. I know, since I
deliberately wrote it that way.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, thanks anyway. It's not worth it. I'm not going to
fight to keep a job I never liked all that much in the first place. Every time
I wanted to do some serious journalism—like that piece about using the Internet
to store everybody's medical records—Jay always found a reason not to run it.
I've only got so much dignity to lose.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He turned and strode out of the office, deciding to forego
any more farewells. Besides, he had better things to do. Get somebody from the
mailroom to carry the boxes—the shards of his erstwhile, so&#8209;called
career—to the lobby, where he could get a cab. Take the files home, stash them,
and then get going.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hi,&quot; he said, walking through the door of Ally's
downtown studio, CitiSpace. Jennifer had the desk at the front and she served
as a makeshift receptionist. She looked up as he continued, &quot;I don't have
an appointment, but I'd love to see Ally Hampton. Any chance?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And you're . . . ?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Just as he started to tell her, Ally emerged from her
office/cubicle in the back and spotted him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Stone! What—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Bet you didn't think you'd see me again quite so
soon.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She felt her pulse jump. No, she hadn't. She'd told him she
was going down to the office, but she'd certainly had no idea (or hope) he'd
just show up a couple of hours later.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2>Since she got back to the office she'd been in a
struggle with her conscience over what to do about Kristen. Was there any good
to be served by bringing in the police? At the time it had seemed pointless and
it still felt that way. The whole matter was awfully anecdotal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Worse, she didn't really feel she should talk it over with</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jennifer, which she would have loved to do. They supported
each other in a lot of things, but this crazy story would just freak her out.
Why do that?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The more troubling thing was, she’d started feeling tired and
slightly dizzy. Now she was just hoping to stay focused long enough to last out
the day. What, she wondered was happening to her? It wasn't like a chest&#8209;tightening
spell of angina—which, thankfully, she hadn't had for a couple of days now. No,
this just felt like something was sapping her energy. She couldn't help the
suspicion that this queasy condition was somehow related to her encounter with
Dr. Van de Vliet's testy blond colleague Debra. While she was supposedly taking
that blood sample, was she also doing something else?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Welcome to my home away from home. You're right, I
didn't expect—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;CitiSpace,&quot; he interjected seeming to try out the
word as he looked around She noticed that Jennifer and the others automatically
assumed he was a new client of hers and were trying to look preoccupied. Jen,
however, was giving him a furtive appraisal, running the numbers. He was a
decent looker, actually kind of cute, and he seemed pleasant and outgoing. Not
a bad start. That was what she would say the moment he was out of earshot.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You like the name?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not bad. Sort of a takeoff on Citibank?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My dad came up with it back before they copyrighted
that name. Maybe they stole the idea from us.&quot; She was feeling cheered by
the sight of him. Yes, it was good to have him back for a while, maybe longer.
&quot;But come on, let me introduce you around&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Which she did. Jennifer gave her a telepathic glance that
said This guy looks like he might be worth the effort. What's the deal?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then they went to Ally's office, a high&#8209;walled cubicle
in the back with a computer and a drafting table. She had a CAD program
running.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sorry to just invite myself down like this,&quot; he
said, &quot;but I got off work early. Matter of fact, I just became a
freelancer. My office now consists of three cardboard boxes in my walk&#8209;up
apartment.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean? That phone page? Did—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Winston Bartlett owns the building where the Sentinel's
offices are. Seems he convinced the management that it would be in their
interest if I were no longer employed there. I gather he thinks I know more
than I actually do about what's going on out at the Dorian Institute, and I
guess he thought getting me fired would slow me down. What it has done,
however, is to give me even more incentive to surpass his most paranoid
assumptions. Now I'm going to take him on full&#8209;time. I want to know
everything.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Oh, Stone, I'm so sorry.&quot; She wasn't buying his
bravado. He didn't look like a guy who could last very long without a paycheck.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I have to say he gave me fair warning. That meeting
where he yelled at me. This little turn of the screw is not a total
shock.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But that whole thing with Kristen . . . I'll bet that's
what sent him over the edge. I shouldn't have gotten you involved in
that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This had nothing to do with you, believe me.&quot; He
shrugged &quot;Besides, it gives me even more motivation to finish the book
fast. And I'm also looking forward to spending some of my newfound quality time
with you again, if you'll let me. In your favor, you've actually been inside
the Dorian Institute, which is more than I can say.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She wasn't a big believer in the magic of a second time
around—that would have to await further evidence—but having Stone back in her
life was definitely helping on the psychological&#8209;support front.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm thinking,&quot; he went on, &quot;that maybe we
should go back to Kristen's apartment and turn the place inside out. Do it
right. We both let ourselves get distracted by the little matter of our other
lives.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Stone, I'm not sure&quot;—she lowered her voice and sat
down at her desk—&quot;but I may be having a reaction to something one of Van
de Vliet's research assistants did to me out at the institute this morning. I
don't know. I'm just feeling sort of weak and... funny. I'm thinking maybe I
should call out there and talk to him.&quot; She took a deep breath and seemed
to be mounting her courage. &quot;Or if he needs to see me, could you possibly
drive for me? I'm not sure I'm up to it&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, I'd love a chance to get inside that place.&quot;
Then his eyes grew uncertain. &quot;But are you sure you want to go back, after
what seems to have happened to Kristen? You might consider waiting till we find
her and—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ally, are you all right?&quot; Jennifer was walking in,
carrying a manila folder. &quot;You look kind of queasy. Can I make you some
tea or something?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Thanks but not now,&quot; she said. &quot;I'm feeling
weird, but maybe I should call out to the institute and see what Van de Vliet
says.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Just don't agree to do anything until we talk,&quot;
Stone said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't worry,&quot; she said reaching for the phone. The
number for the Dorian Institute was now newly entered on her Palm Pilot and she
called it. When the receptionist answered she gave her name and asked for Dr.
Van de Vliet. &quot;I was there this morning and gave a blood sample to Dr.
Debra Connolly. I don't know if there's any connection, but I'm really feeling
strange right now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean by 'strange'?&quot; the woman asked.
&quot;Can you describe how you feel exactly? He's in the lab downstairs.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's just it I'm not sure I need to actually see him.
I'd just like to talk to him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He doesn't like to be disturbed. Unless it's something
very important.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's important enough for me to try to call him,&quot;
she declared feeling herself abruptly seething. &quot;I'm weak and dizzy. And
my stomach is not in such great shape either.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What did you have for lunch?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My God, she realized she hadn't actually had any. After the
disaster with Kristen, she'd been in such turmoil that she hadn't even thought
about food.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>On the other hand, she knew what food deprivation felt like.
This was something else.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I didn't have all that much lunch, but that's not the
problem. Now will you please put me through?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let me see what I can do,&quot; she said. &quot;I'll
call down and ask him. He might be able to see you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally listened as the line went blank.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was when she remembered she had some smoked turkey in the
office fridge. Maybe a quick sandwich was called for.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>While she waited, Stone was looking around the offices,
taking everything in. Carrying the phone, she walked out and followed him.
What, she wondered, was the place telling him about her? The meager furniture
was low&#8209;slung and utilitarian, with lots of beige and dark brown. And
there were several huge storage files for blueprints and designs. There also
was a comfortable easy chair and lamp near a bookcase in the corner. On the
table next to the chair were two British mysteries and a thick, recently
written history of New York City.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He walked over and picked it up. It was 760 pages long.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>“This your idea of reading for relaxation?&quot; he asked,
waving it at her. &quot;I tried to get through it, but I only got up to the
1930s and then I started having a bout of acute sleeping sickness every time I
picked it up.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, the history of this city is a mental hobby of
mine. It's always renewing itself.&quot; She smiled. &quot;Think about it. When
developers convert industrial space to residential, we end up getting a lot of
work.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then she heard the phone crackle alive. It was Van de Vliet.
&quot;Alexa, what seems to be the problem?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She told him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then I think it's important that you come back out here
as soon as you can. I can't say anything until I've seen you. This could be
something that could affect your procedure.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But what do you think—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't diagnose over the phone. I was about to go
home, but I'll wait for you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She listened as he clicked off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Shit.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What did he say?&quot; Stone asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He said I've got to come out.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do you really want to do that?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't know. But what's the point of going to a doctor
here? They wouldn't know—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then at least let me drive you,&quot; Stone declared.
&quot;And I'll make damned sure they don't pull something funny.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ally,&quot; Jennifer said ,&quot;you look absolutely
wiped out. Before you do anything, at least let me fix you a sandwich. I think
there's some turkey in the fridge.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I was thinking about that.&quot; She glanced at Stone.
&quot;You want something?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sure. I'll have whatever you're having.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't be so sure. Jen can tell you I take mayo and
mustard both. I know it's weird but that's the way I am.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then I'll give it a try. I want to get to know you all
over again.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Also, I hate to say it, but I think maybe I ought to
swing by the apartment and get some things. Just in case.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She listened to her own voice and wondered, would whatever
happened to Kristen happen to me too?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Maybe, she thought, what I really ought to take with me is a
gun. Maybe Katherine Starr had the right idea.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Jennifer finished the sandwiches and was wrapping them.
&quot;Ally, I'll go with you to you</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
 color:windowtext'>r place</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
and pick up Knickers. She can stay with me till you know what's going on.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Thanks, Jen. I was hoping you'd volunteer.&quot; She
knew she could have dropped a hint and made it happen anyway, but this was
nicer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She then went around and had a few last words. It felt like a
good&#8209;bye and she didn't want it to. But it did.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ten minutes later, while Stone waited in her double&#8209;parked
car, she and Jennifer took the elevator up to her Barrow Street apartment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Where did you find that man?&quot; Jennifer
asked as soon as they got on. &quot;He seems nice. Interesting. He's not a
client, is he? And, pardon me for noticing, no wedding ring.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He actually found me,&quot; Ally declared, punching her
floor. &quot;It's a long story, but he was a guy I was deeply in love with for
about fifteen minutes back around college. The old flame I told you about,
remember? Then we started getting on each other's nerves. We're both going easy
on the personal details right now, but I've got a hunch he's got nobody else
percolating. Which, incidentally, goes for me too, or hadn't you noticed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They stepped off the elevator and she unlocked the door to
her apartment. Knickers exploded with delight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hi, baby.&quot; She reached down and ruffled the
sheepdog's ears.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I really love her,&quot; Jennifer said as she reached
down to pet her too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Knickers began a dance of joy, then ran to search for her
rubber ball behind the couch, hoping for a game of fetch with Jennifer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;By the way, I can't tell you how I appreciate your
taking her. She's going to love being at you</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
 color:windowtext'>r place</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
awhile. I'm sure she gets bored crazy being here all the time. I probably
should get a puppy or something to keep her company, but then she'd be jealous.
And I'm not about to get a stupid cat.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She loves me because she knows I love her,&quot;
Jennifer said. &quot;I always play with her when you bring her into the office.
At least I think she loves me. This may turn out to be the test.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally headed into the bedroom, opened a drawer, and took out
some black sweatshirts. Those and black jeans were her favorite things to wear
around the house. She slept in a T&#8209;shirt and panties, so it wasn't hard
to put together her evening ensemble. Besides, if something went wrong with the
experimental stem cell procedure, it wouldn't matter a damn what she was
wearing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She threw the clothes into a blue gym bag and headed for the
bathroom to fetch some toiletries. By the time she got back to the living room,
Jennifer had a measuring cup and was shoveling Science Diet into a large
plastic bag.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They delivered Jen and Knickers back to the office. After she
gave them both a farewell hug, she came around and slipped into the Toyota's
driver's seat, moving Stone across.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm actually feeling better now, so I'll drive as long
as I can. And by the way, I'm famished. How about that turkey sandwich?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Thought you'd never remember.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Five minutes later, they were headed up the West Side, with
Ally at the wheel. She checked the gas and was relieved to see that she still
had two&#8209;thirds of a tank. Stone was leaning back in the seat looking at
her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know, it's easy for me to say, but trying the stem
cell procedure on your heart is probably the right thing for you to do. Still,
though, it makes me nervous. If there's a medical glitch of some kind then . .
. I mean, what the hell is going on with Kristen?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm going to confront him about that,&quot; she said
&quot;I damned well want some answers before I just turn myself over to
him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After they crossed the George Washington Bridge, she began
feeling slightly better. Maybe, she thought, whatever it is is going to pass.
As they headed north up the tree&#8209;shrouded highway, she decided to ask him
a question that had been nagging at her mind.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Stone, I know you hate to have these talks, but
something about you doesn't quite compute for me right now. There's a kind of
unnatural intensity about your pursuit of Winston Bartlett and his stem cell
work. And the same goes for his reaction to you. Way back when, I never really
thought I knew you, and it's still true. I mean, is this all just about a book
on stem cell technology? Or is it something more?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The question was followed by a long moment of silence as he
looked away, into the forest, and appeared to wrestle with his thoughts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're very intuitive, Ally,&quot; he said at last
&quot;Maybe I didn't consciously set out to write about stem cells just because
I knew Bartlett's Gerex Corporation was a leader in the field. But writing
about stem cells automatically meant that I'd have to get close to him at some
point. So was it an unconscious choice? If it was, then I wouldn't be aware of
it would I?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But why would you want to get close to Winston
Bartlett?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I guess that was your original question, right?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Pretty much.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There are things about my past that I never told you. I
could never decide exactly how to go about it. And truthfully, right now
doesn't seem exactly the right moment either. You've got enough on your
mind&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Want to give me a hint?&quot; What could he mean? she
wondered. It was clear that Stone Aimes and Winston Bartlett had some kind of
holy war going on between them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll tell you someday soon. But I want us both sitting
down in a safe place when I do. It's going to be hard.&quot; He looked away
again. &quot;Someday soon I've got to tell my daughter, Amy, too. Maybe telling
you would be a practice drill.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So what I'm learning is that I'm not crazy. This is
about more than it's about?&quot; She sighed. &quot;Nobody's leveling with me.
With Van de Vliet I have to worry whether he's telling me the truth every time
he opens his mouth. And now you're holding out. It’s like that joke about
feeling like a mushroom. Everybody keeps me in the dark and feeds me
bullshit.&quot; She was slowing down, pulling into an open space by the
roadside. &quot;Stone, I'm feeling a little dizzy. Maybe it's this
conversation, but I think it's time you took the wheel for a while.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, don't pass out on me now,&quot; he said, snapping
into the moment. &quot;I'm not sure I could actually find this place without
your help.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't worry,&quot; she said, bringing the car to a
stop. &quot;I'm all right. I'm just a little worried about my reflexes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He got out and walked around, while she hoisted herself over
into the other side.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The evening commute had begun in earnest, so there was a lot
more traffic than there had been that morning. But Stone turned out to be an
aggressive driver, right on the edge, as though he were racing the clock. She
gave him directions and then closed her eyes, hoping to rest. But all she could
think about was Stone's refusal to tell her about something that loomed very
large in his life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tell me if I'm bothering you and I'll shut up,&quot; he
interjected after a few minutes, &quot;but—not to change the subject—did you
actually give anybody permission to stick a needle in you this morning? I mean,
are you sure you understood what was going on at the time?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She shifted and opened her eyes, looking straight ahead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Truthfully, I assumed I was just giving a blood sample.
That's what his assistant said and I took her at her word. I hate needles and I
never actually watch when I give blood. This morning I just sort of went along
with what was happening. And nothing seemed particularly ominous till Katherine
Starr showed up and started blasting away.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;do your best to get some
rest and I'll try to get you there as soon as legally possible.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She stared out the window a moment before closing her eyes
again. Around them the encroaching greenery of northern New Jersey felt like an
ancient forest where magical things could happen. Out here in the forest, was
there a magician who had the power literally to save her life?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And what about Stone? Setting aside the troubling fact that
he was harboring some mysterious connection to Winston Bartlett—and that was
hard to set aside—she was feeling a sense of togetherness with him that brought
back a lot of positive memories. Which was bizarre, because she knew so little
about what kind of man he'd become. If people are worth their salt, they change
a lot in their late twenties and early thirties. So what was he really like
now? What did he love? What did he hate? What were his priorities? Did he
believe in the Golden Rule?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Mulling over all this, she slowly drifted away. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Dusk was approaching by the time he pulled to a stop at the
gated entrance of the Dorian Institute. Along the way he'd begun getting a
sense that they were being followed by a dark&#8209;colored Lincoln Town Car,
but it could have been his imagination. And he hadn't seen it for the past
fifteen minutes, after he pulled onto the leafy lakeside drive leading to the
institute.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, we're here, Ally. Rise and shine. How're you
feeling?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There was no response when he touched her.</span></p>

and shook her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2>&quot;Where . . . ?&quot; She looked around.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Oh shit, Stone, I'm feeling really strange,&quot; she
said after a moment of getting her bearings. &quot;Everything around me seems
like it's moving. It's as though the space I'm in has an extra dimension. I
don't know . . . maybe it was totally stupid to come back out here. Maybe I
should have just gone to my doctor in the city.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, you've got a seriously deficient sense of timing.

color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, you could start by trusting me. I'm along to try

do?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A brass plaque on a redbrick pillar beside the gate bore a
two&#8209;inch&#8209;high inscription,<span style='text-transform:uppercase'>
the dorian institute</span>, and just below it was an intercom. She stared at
it for a moment, then said, &quot;There, give it a buzz. I think there's a
video camera around here somewhere. Last time I was here, they knew I'd
arrived.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

color:windowtext'>&quot;It's Alexa Hampton.&quot; She leaned over. &quot;We
talked—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, I know, Ms. Hampton. He's been waiting for
you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A buzzer sounded and the two wrought&#8209;iron gates slid
back, welcoming them. As they drove down the tree&#8209;lined road, an elegant
three&#8209;story redbrick structure with white Doric columns across the front
slowly came into view.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;From here, it's pretty classy&#8209;looking,&quot;
Stone declared, sizing it up. &quot;I know his big manufacturing&#8209;and&#8209;research
campus is right down the road. But still, it sure feels godforsaken and lost out
here in the middle of these pines. It's like the place is hiding from the
world.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Where better to do secret medical research,&quot; she
said. &quot;If you want to keep everything proprietary, then the isolation
gives you a big jump on security.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She directed him to the side parking lot, where she'd left
her car that morning.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Stone, here's what we'll tell them. You're next of kin,
a cousin on my mother's side.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Works for me,&quot; he declared. &quot;I'm beginning to
feel part of the family anyway.&quot; He pocketed the car keys and helped her
out of the Toyota.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As they headed up the wide steps, past the white columns,
Ally felt a wave of nausea sweep through her. She reached out and took Stone's
arm and sank against him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm... I'm not feeling at all well. Please let me
hold—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No sooner had she said it than the front door opened and two
nurses appeared, their hair backlit from the glow of the reception area. She
recognized one as Ellen O'Hara.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Here, dear, let us help you,&quot; she said as she
strode toward them. She was dressed in white and her eyes were flooded with
concern. Ally looked through the doorway to see a waiting wheelchair.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's fast,&quot; Stone said. &quot;Looks like they
were ready for you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My God, she thought, did they already know what kind of shape
I'd be in? What else do they know? Surely Van de Vliet has heard by now that
I'm aware of Kristen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then she saw him standing behind the nurses.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Alexa, we need to get you downstairs as soon as
possible.&quot; He was coming forward to help her settle into the wheelchair.
He appeared to take no notice of Stone Aimes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm just feeling a little dizzy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He smiled reassuringly. &quot;There's always a small
percentage chance that there may be side effects from the initial
inoculation.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Huh?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What 'initial inoculation'?&quot; She bolted upright in
the wheelchair. &quot;I was just supposed to be giving blood.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I thought Debra explained,&quot; he said, appearing
confused. &quot;There's always an initial . . . antibiotic dosage, just as a
prophylactic.&quot; He shook his head in self&#8209;blame. &quot;I should have
insisted you stay here, but after that . . . incident this morning I was so
disoriented I let you talk me out of it. You may be having a reaction to the
antibiotic, but it can't be all that serious. I didn't see anything about side
effects in your file. We just have to get you horizontal for a while.
Everything's going to be all right. In fact, this might be a positive
development. With you here now, we can begin fine&#8209;tuning your procedure
immediately.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Dr. Van de Vliet, this is my cousin Stone. He drove me
here and I'd—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'd really like to stay,&quot; Stone said reaching to
shake Van de Vliet's hand. &quot;It would mean a lot to both of us. To the
whole family.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Family?&quot; Van de Vliet declared. Ally noticed that
he was</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>examining
Stone with narrowed eyes and seemed to be debating something with himself.
&quot;Well, we'll see.&quot; Then he turned back to her. &quot;The first thing
is to make sure your. . . situation is stabilized. I actually think a good
night's rest might do the trick. But I need to run a quick blood test downstairs.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She felt her dizziness coming and going, but she was
determined to stay awake and in control of what was being done to her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;By the way, I was wondering how is Katherine Starr
doing?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>His eyes grew somber. &quot;She's a very lucky woman,
considering. We've given her some coagulants and stitched her up.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Are you going to press charges?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He looked at her strangely. &quot;Do you think we
should?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I guess it's none of my business.&quot; Of course you
won't, she told herself. The Kristen matter will not stand the ordinary light
of day, let alone a police investigation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe it's time to let her daughter come and see
her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I looked at that letter,&quot; he said with a matter&#8209;of&#8209;fact
tone. &quot;I suspect it's a hoax. And a very cruel one at that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't think so. I talked to her today. The woman
formerly known as Kristen. On the phone.&quot; She stared at him. &quot;I
really think it's time I learned more about what happened to her here at the
institute. All I could really find out was that she thinks she's experienced
some pretty dramatic memory loss.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He looked as though this information was new to him. He also
looked startled. &quot;You spoke to her? What . . . did she say? Is she all
right?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, she's not all right.&quot; Don't mention the
kidnapping she told herself. Play dumb and see how he behaves. &quot;I want to
know what happened to her when she was here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He paused, then took a deep breath. &quot;I told you
everything I know this morning. She was a very troubled young person. Her
treatment seemed to be going well, but she couldn't accept that. She began to
believe there was some kind of conspiracy against her. In a word, she became
completely paranoid.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, Ally thought, there's &quot;paranoid&quot; and then
there are times when somebody really is out to get you. So which was it in
Kristen's case?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She glanced over at Stone, who appeared to be trying to act
as though he didn't know what on earth she was talking about. But she could see
him efficiently taking mental notes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;When you can't remember who you are,&quot; she said
turning back to Van de Vliet, &quot;and then someone who does know who you are
gives you a new, fake identity, I think it's enough to justify paranoia.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was rolling the wheelchair toward the elevator but
abruptly paused</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is that what she's claiming? Good God I told you she
was paranoid and that should demonstrate it better than anything. Letting her
discharge herself and leave the program, to go off unsupervised was a truly bad
idea, but nothing short of physical restraint could have stopped her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And do you have any idea where she is now?&quot; Ally
asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I told you . . . Look, if I knew her whereabouts, don't
you think I'd do everything I could to contact her, find out how she is?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Right.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She reached out and took Stone’s hand as they all moved onto
the elevator. She could sense his excitement at finally being inside the Dorian
Institute, but at that moment her concentration was drifting and she felt as
though she were slowly beginning to drown in a sea of white.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Stone, please don't leave me. Don't let me out of your
sight. Something funny is happening and I don't know what it is.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Van de Vliet bent over. &quot;Alexa, look at me. I want to
see your eyes. I think they may be dilating.&quot; He waved a hand across her
face. &quot;Can you see me?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's the fluorescent lights,&quot; she mumbled
&quot;There's too much glare. Could someone please turn them down? I think
that's what's wrong. They're giving me a headache.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ally,&quot; Stone said, &quot;the lights are not very
bright in here. We're going down in an elevator. There aren't any
fluorescents.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then the elevator chimed and the door opened. They were in
the basement now, where the research lab and the office and the examination
rooms were. Debra, wearing a white lab coat, was standing there silently
looking at her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now there really were fluorescent lights, and she turned away
and tried to shield her eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;God, turn them off. It's so painful. It's like they're
shining into the back of my skull.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She's started hallucinating,&quot; Van de Vliet
whispered to Debra. &quot;I've got to draw blood for a test and give her an
injection. We need a gurney now. We've got to take her down to the IC. Her
condition is progressing much more rapidly than I expected.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ally, is this what you want?&quot; Stone demanded.
&quot;You don't have to do this.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Her breath was coming in rapid pulses now and she was
cringing from the light even as she struggled to rise out of the wheelchair.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I want . . . to get . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She managed to pull herself onto her feet, but then she
sagged and collapsed against Stone as he pulled her to him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As one of the nurses grabbed the newly arrived gurney and
pulled it over, Van de Vliet and Ellen O'Hara seized her out of Stone’s arms
and lifted her onto it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You'll have to leave now,&quot; Van de Vliet said to
Stone. &quot;I'm sorry.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm not going anywhere. I promised her I'd stay by her
side and, by God, I intend to do just that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll determine what's best for her,&quot; he replied.
&quot;Please go up to the reception area. I'll let you know how she is.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm not leaving.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then I'll call our security and have you removed from
the premises.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Stone,&quot; Ally said her eyelids flickering,
&quot;it's okay. I want you to tell my mother I'm here. She's in room two&#8209;thirteen,
upstairs, the last time I saw her.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You've got it. Don't worry. I'll take care of
everything.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She heard him saying that, but then she thought she heard
another voice inside her head begging him not to leave. It was the last thought
she had before the world went entirely white.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<h2>Wednesday, April 8 </h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext;
text-transform:uppercase'>7:39 p.m.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ellen O'Hara watched the scene with mounting dismay. She'd
overheard Dr. Van de Vliet talking to Debbie about the procedure scheduled for
Alexa Hampton. Then she'd checked the schedule that had been put into the
database. It turned out that Alexa Hampton had two procedures scheduled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The troubling part was, one was identical to the procedure
that had been performed on Kristen Starr several months back, or at least so it
seemed. And that had resulted in what she'd just overheard Debra call &quot;the
Syndrome.&quot; By whatever name, it had produced some horrible side effects.
Why on earth were they now repeating that with this new patient? Hadn't they
learned anything?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Karl Van de Vliet—or whoever ordered this idiotic
travesty—was about to put the job of every person at the Dorian Institute at
risk. If whatever happened to Kristen was replicated and the word got out, it
was going to be the end for everyone who worked here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Most troubling of all, what about Ms. Hampton, who seemed
like such a nice person? Did she agree to that experimental procedure? If she
knew what had happened to Kristen Starr, surely she wouldn't have.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ellen O'Hara didn't know how she could stop Dr. Vee from
doing what he appeared to be planning to do. The procedure was going to be
performed in the laboratory.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The only way she could think of to stop it was to try to warn
Ms. Hampton that what they were about to do was extremely dangerous. But how?
Her chart in the database said they were going to keep her quarantined down in
the sub&#8209; basement. That was specified.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>On top of all this, Kenji Noda had brought in some
unidentified patient this afternoon, wheeled in while strapped to a gurney, and
they had taken that patient to the subbasement. Noda was still down there, and
Winston Bartlett had come in and gone down also. The unholy pair. And now
they'd be holding Alexa Hampton down there too.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Was it possible to get past them and warn her?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was determined to find a way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Stone was deeply troubled as he entered the elevator to
return to the lobby. He had promised Ally he'd stay by her side and now he'd
let her down. Was this the best he could do? He felt like he had to earn the
right to be back in her life, but he seemed to be making a slow start.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But he wasn't about to leave the premises until he knew she
was okay.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hoping for the best, he reminded himself that although Van de
Vliet was wound pretty tight, he clearly was more than competent. The problem
was, he'd just offered a transparent song and dance when Ally asked him about
Kristen. Now it was easy to understand why she'd said she didn't know whether
to believe a word he said. But that didn't necessarily preclude him being a
Nobel Prize&#8209;quality medical genius.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In any case, to finally be inside the Dorian Institute was a
major coup in his own quest. Up until now, Bartlett's press heavies at BMD had
turned back his every attempt to get a first&#8209;hand look at the institute
or an interview with Karl Van de Vliet. Now, at last, he'd actually seen the
man.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So . . . after he visited with Ally's mother upstairs—which
ought to be interesting, an actual patient interview—he was going to try to
keep a low profile and scout the place. Maybe he could finally talk his way
into an interview with the celebrated Van de Vliet himself, or at least with
some of his research staff. This was definitely the break he'd been waiting
for. Finally he'd have some actual reporting to put in the book.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When he stepped off the elevator, he noticed that the
uniformed security guard looked him over suspiciously. He and Alexa had been
waved through the metal detector when they came in, owing to the urgency of her
condition. Now he felt as though the guard, a tall, middle&#8209;aged black guy
with thinning hair, was trying to frisk him with his penetrating eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Stone smiled and nodded toward him and headed for the desk in
the middle of the reception area. Around him a number of patients were ambling
through the lobby, returning from a room in the back that was identified as<span
style='text-transform:uppercase'> dining hall. </span>Some were wearing blue
gowns, and most appeared to be in their sixties and seventies. But they all
were sprightly and animated as they walked along chatting. Somehow the place
felt more like a vacation spa than a clinic. He'd like nothing better than to
sit them all down right this minute for an interview. &quot;How has the Gerex
stem cell procedure affected your condition? Have you had any side
effects?&quot; But to do that without official permission would undoubtedly get
him evicted on the spot.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He took a deep breath and walked over to the reception desk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hi.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The woman looked up. She was the same middle&#8209;aged
Hispanic nurse with bold eye makeup who was there when they came in. &quot;Hi.
How's your friend feeling?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Actually, she's my cousin, and I don't know how she's
doing because they kicked . . . sent me up here. But she gave me a mission to
keep me occupied.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well,&quot; the woman declared with a smile, &quot;I'm
sure she'll be fine. Dr. Van de Vliet is a miracle worker.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So everyone says.&quot; He smiled back. &quot;My cousin
asked me to look in on her mother. Nina Hampton. She is, or was, in two&#8209;thirteen.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mrs. Hampton is your aunt?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Uh, yeah, right.&quot; Whoops. Get this act together.
&quot;Funny, but I always just think of her as my cousin Ally's mother. My own
weird way to look at it, I guess. I don't really know her all that well.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Things are not getting off to a great start, he told himself.
I don't even believe me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Visits to patients, except by those on a pre&#8209;established
list, require a photo ID.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, let's get started.&quot; He reached for his
wallet and withdrew a driver's license. He made sure his press card was well
out of sight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Keep this dumb and innocent as long as possible, he told
himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She glanced at the driver's license, then pointed to the sign&#8209;in
sheet. &quot;Just sign your name and print it and then also print your
relationship to the patient. I have to say this is unusual. There are regular
visiting hours and guests are normally approved in advance by Mrs. Young, who's
in charge of security. But you came in under extraordinary circumstances, with
Ms. Hampton, and you're already here, so I don't see the harm.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He signed himself in as quickly as possible.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mrs. Hampton is still in room two&#8209;thirteen.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll show myself up.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Please keep it under fifteen minutes. We don't want to
tire her out. You understand.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Thanks. I really appreciate this. My cousin Ally likes
to get an update on&quot;—he realized he had momentarily blocked her mother's
name—&quot;her mom as often as possible.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He headed for the elevator, trying to contain his excitement.
The idea was to keep this as below the radar as possible. Was he about to crack
the wall of secrecy that Winston Bartlett had erected around Karl Van de Vliet
and the Gerex Corporation?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Just as the elevator door was closing, he saw a figure emerge
through the security entryway. The man clicked a memory&#8209;moment from
somewhere in the far&#8209;distant past, but he couldn't place him. As best he
could tell, the guy didn't see him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Just keep moving. Don't look back</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he stepped off the elevator onto the second floor, the
pale marble floors were lit by small bulbs along the walls. This was a place
where medical miracles were supposedly being made to happen and yet it was lit
only with a ghostly half&#8209;light. The sounds of televisions emanated from
several of the rooms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The nurse's station at the end of the hall was empty, which
added to the sense of a surreptitious undertaking.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He walked quickly to room 213 and tapped lightly on the door.
When he heard a bold &quot;Yes?&quot; from inside, he opened it and entered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He hadn't seen Nina Hampton in almost two decades, but she
looked pretty much the way he remembered her. Her hair was surely dyed now, but
her face was as square and strong as ever. She was reading a paperback book
with a tide that appeared to be Spanish. She looked up and stared at him for a
moment, adjusting her glasses.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hello, Stone. That is you, isn't it? You're older but
you're still a hell of a looker. How did you get in here? Is Ally here too? I
haven't seen her since this morning.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mrs. Hampton, don't tell me you recognize me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course I do. When you and Ally were . . . going out,
I confess I didn't hold out much hope that you'd ever amount to anything, but
I've been a fan of your columns for a long time. Though it took me a while to
put it together that that newspaper writer I liked so much was you, the man I
didn't think was ambitious enough for my daughter.&quot; She appraised him a moment.
&quot;Does this mean you two are together again?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Good question, he thought. And I don't have a clue about the
answer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I wish I knew. Why don't you ask her the next time you
see her?&quot; He smiled and walked over. &quot;She wanted me to come up and
see how you're doing.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Come up? Is she here now? When she came to say goodbye
this morning, I got the impression that she wanted both of us just to get out
of here. But I told her that was silly. I'm already feeling so much
better.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Really. Well, she's downstairs now and she'll be happy
to hear that.&quot; He walked over and smiled. &quot;Mrs. Hampton, I came along
with her this time to keep an eye on her. Hope you don't mind.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Of course not.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And there's another reason I'm here. I want to warn
you. I'm writing a book about stem cell procedures and anything you say to me
about your treatment could well end up in it. So don't tell me anything you
don't want everybody to hear about.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Are you really writing a book about Dr. Vee?&quot; She
beamed. &quot;That's wonderful! He's a saint. Everyone here says so. He
deserves a special place in heaven.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This is great, Stone thought. I've got my own Deep Throat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then could I ask you what you know about what he did
and how you think you've improved.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't really understand what he's doing, but I do know
what is happening to me. It's as though my mind was full of fog a lot of the
time, but now there's a wind that's blowing it away.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And how—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A shaft of light from the hallway pierced across the room as
the door opened. Stone turned to see the man he'd first noticed in the lobby.
The man walked past him and marched over to the bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hi, how're you feeling?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm touched.&quot; Her visage immediately hardened
&quot;It's thoughtful of you to finally come by and favor your mother with a
visit.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That's who he is, Stone finally realized. Ally's kid brother.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In his few dealings with the wiseass brat that Ally used to
rant about—what was the kid's name . . . right, Grant—he'd found him devious
and pompous. He was particularly deft at cutting ethical corners and using other
people any way he could</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Stone,&quot; Nina Hampton said gesturing toward Grant,
&quot;this is—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I know exactly who he is,&quot; Grant said turning
around to face Stone. &quot;W.B. has put out an all&#8209;points alert for you,
pal. You've got a hell of a nerve weaseling your way in here. But not to worry.
You won't be here long.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I won't have you talking that way in my presence, young
man,&quot; Nina declared &quot;Whatever else you may be, I thought I'd raised
you to have a civil tongue in your head&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Grant replied without taking his eyes off Stone. &quot;He
lied to the front desk, Nina. He signed in as Ally's cousin. And that twit&#8209;brain
down there let him get away with it. He got up here by using a lie. Now what
does that tell you about him?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It tells me he's creative. This man came with your
sister. He's helping take care of her, which is more than can be said about her
own brother.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This creep is a newspaper reporter, Nina. He's here to
spy. He’s planning to do a hatchet job on the Gerex Corporation, and Mr.
Bartlett has expressly forbidden anyone to speak to him&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm not in your corporation, Son, so I guess it’s all
right for me then.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You signed a secrecy agreement with Gerex when you
entered the clinical trials. Now maybe you don't remember it, but you did&quot;
He turned to Stone. &quot;Nice try, amigo. Now come on, let's go.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know, Grant, I remember you,&quot; Stone said
&quot;Not very nice recollections.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And I remember you too, pal. You were that screwed&#8209;up
journalism student Ally dated for a while. Thank God she got rid of you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sounds like we were awash in mutual admiration,&quot;
Stone said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>“Tell you what. Are we gonna continue this touching reunion
outside, or do I have to call for security and take your trespassing ass out of
here in handcuffs? It's entirely up to you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Grant, I see no reason why I can't talk to him if I
want,&quot; Nina interjected &quot;Who I talk to or what I say is nobody's
business but mine.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You wouldn't be here if it weren't for me,&quot; Grant
declared. &quot;So I have a little say&#8209;so too.&quot; He turned back.
&quot;Come on, pal. We're gone.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I'm screwed, Stone told himself. But what about Ally? If I
get kicked out, I'll really be leaving her completely defenseless.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mrs. Hampton, thank you for letting me check up on
you,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;Alexa is downstairs. I think her procedure is
starting whether she's ready for it or not. You seem very alert, and if I were
you, I'd try to monitor her . . . progress as closely as you can.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't worry,&quot; Grant said. &quot;I'll be keeping
close tabs on her. And now let's go.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>With no option short of killing him on the spot, Stone
followed along, seething. This little creep obviously works for Winston
Bartlett—he wished Ally had warned him about that. Grant was bound to have
shown up at some point.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They went down the marble staircase and Grant signaled the
security man, who leaped up and opened the front door for them. He probably got
a tongue&#8209;lashing from Grant, Stone told himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As they stepped onto the wide porch, dusk all around them,
Grant turned and headed toward the south end and a long wooden bench.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Want to tell me what the hell's going on?&quot; he said
gesturing toward the bench and then sitting down. &quot;W.B. said you claimed
to be writing a book about this project. If that's true, then it's a seriously
bad idea. You have no idea what he's capable of if he gets pissed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Oh, I think I'm getting a rough idea, but I'm a little
pissed too,&quot; Stone said, remaining standing. &quot;For example, there's
the matter of Kristen Starr. You see, she was terminated from the clinical
trials approximately three months back. So I was wondering, when is Van de
Vliet planning to report her current condition to the NIH?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't know what you're talking about.&quot; His
startled voice said otherwise.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Oh, I think you do. I saw her today.&quot; Then he
decided to bluff. &quot;She had an interesting tale to tell. She—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Shit, you interviewed Kristy? Aw, man, don't believe
anything she . . .&quot; He hesitated. &quot;What did she say about W.B.?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Tell you what, we'll play twenty questions. You tell me
what you think she said and I'll tell you if you're right or not.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey,&quot; Grant declared, his eyes intense, &quot;she
wanted to do it man. Nobody put a gun to her head or anything. She was freaking
out after she got sacked. She thought Dr. Vee could fix her skin and she
couldn't wait to try it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You mean—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The Beta. Take a look at Van de Vliet. He's a walking
testimonial. No side effects for him, so why not? The worst thing that could
happen would be nothing, right? So she figured, what did she have to lose?
Well, now we all know.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The Beta? That's...?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You fucker.&quot; Grant bounded to his feet. &quot;You
don't know the first thing about what I'm talking about do you? How the fuck
did you find out about Kristen anyway?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I told you I spoke to her.&quot; Well, it was almost
true. He'd yelled at her. &quot;She's very . . . unsettled just now. But I
guess you know that&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, she was always fucked&#8209;up, but W.B. liked all
the energy behind that. He looked right past the eating disorders and the coke
and the late&#8209;night clubs she went to all the time. But, man, if you think
she's spaced, try her mother. That crazy—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Grant, why not level with me? There's something very
wrong going on here. I'm in the business of telling the truth, and I've got a
keen nose for medical horse&#8209;pucky. So how about coming clean? If it's
good, why not, and if it's bad, it's going to come out eventually anyway.
Hasn't Winston Bartlett learned anything from all the screw&#8209;ups in
Washington? It's not the situation—it's the cover&#8209;up.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, I don't know what Kristy did or didn't tell you,
so we're not going in that direction. I heard about her little trip downtown
this morning. I assume that's probably when you saw her, if in fact you
actually did. Right now she's being taken care of, for her own good.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot; 'Being taken care of'? So happens I had a close
encounter with a couple of her caregivers today. They're taking care of her,
all right.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Look, she used to be W.B.'s girlfriend okay? He's still
very concerned about her. Everybody's really sorry about her situation, but
nobody saw it coming. And now he's got some problems of his own.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You seem to be pretty heavily involved with Winston
Bartlett's personal problems.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yeah, well, the man's been like a father to me. And I
think he feels that way too, since he doesn't have a son of his own.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Stone let the taunt just hang in the air for a moment. He
mainly just wanted to slug the smug little bastard.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You don't know how little you know, about him or about
anything. Someday I may take the trouble to straighten you out. But right now
you're not worth the effort. All I care about at the moment is what's going to
happen to Ally.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Everybody cares what happens to her. A lot depends on
it. Dr. Vee thinks she's our best shot&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What . . . what the hell are you talking about?&quot;
Stone stared at him through the twilight. &quot;What depends on it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Guess you're not as smart as you think you are.&quot;
He was up and heading for the parking lot. &quot;Come on, pal. Time to hit the
road. I'm gonna tuck you in. This conversation is terminated. And it never
happened anyway. I'll have them unlock the gates for you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Wednesday,
April 8 </span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Alexa watches as the prow of their forty&#8209;one&#8209;foot
Morgan, two&#8209;masted, cuts silently through a placid sea. She vaguely
remembers the vessel. It was teak and magnificent. Steve had chartered it, bare&#8209;boat,
for two weeks and taken them cruising through the Bahamas. By the end of that
time, she felt they could have sailed it around the world.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But that was six years ago, when he was still very much
alive. Now the boat feels like a magical carpet taking them someplace together,
effortlessly. The genoa, the mainsail, and the mizzen are all full and
blossoming outward even though there's no wind. She's at the helm, holding a
course toward something white on the horizon, and Steve is with her. He's alive
again and he's with her. She feels her body suffused with joy. Then she looks
at the reflection of herself in his sunglasses and realizes she's a little
girl, still a child. This is all a dream, she realizes, a cruel dream. Then she
looks again at the horizon, the blazing white light, and senses that it
represents the future. Their destiny.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now the sea around them, which had been placid, starts to
roil. The wheel is becoming harder to control, and the sun is starting to burn
her. In its pitiless glare she feels herself beginning to age rapidly. She
glances at Steve and she can see his skin starting to shrivel. She senses he is
dying, right there before her eyes, but her hands feel glued to the wheel and
she can't let go to try to help him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now the sea is growing ever more choppy and the white symbol
on the horizon has begun to bob in and out of view. Sometimes she can see the
&quot;future&quot; and sometimes she can't. Waves are crashing over the sides,
inundating the deck, and she feels anxious about what lies up ahead. Will they
ever get there, and if they do, will she want what she finds? Even more
important now, will Steve still be with her?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As the waves pound against them both, oddly she doesn't feel
wet. Instead, what she feels is a stab of muted pain in her upper chest, pain
she knows would be searing if she were to experience its full impact. She looks
down to see that the wheel she thought she was holding is gone, and her chest
is pierced by the steel mechanism to which it was attached. It has gone all the
way through her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Next a huge wave comes straight over the bow and slams
against her and Steve. Her body convulses with pain and she senses that he is
being swept overboard, directly off the stern. She screams at him to hold on,
but then he is gone, lost in the dark sea.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now the boat itself is starting to disintegrate, as both
masts tip backwards, then come crashing down. Up ahead, the white light that is
the future is growing ever more flame&#8209;like. It is part of a shoreline she
is trying to reach, but now she doesn't think she's going to get there. Around
her, the boat's lines and cleats are being swept into the pounding sea.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In moments the boat has disappeared, but she continues on,
propelled by some force she cannot see, until she finally crashes onto the
rocky shore.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It is a chiaroscuro landscape of blacks and whites. Oddly,
Stone Aimes has appeared and is holding her hand as they make their way along
the barren seascape, where everything is hazy and trapped in fog. She thinks
she sees figures lurking in the mist around them but can't make out who they
are. Everything is static and frozen in place, like the images of motion on the
Grecian urn caught for eternity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She reaches out to touch Stone and her hand passes right
through. That's when she realizes the white light and this rocky shoreline
represent the other side. Is this what death feels like? she wonders. Like the
white tunnel drawing you in?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But then she has another thought. Maybe she isn't dead at
all. Maybe she is in a third place, somewhere suspended between life and death.
She looks again at Stone and tells herself they're not dead, they're in some
kind of time machine. This voyage is about time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now time has begun to flow around her like a river. Days,
weeks, months, years, they all course by. But she knows it is a chimera.
Nothing can make time go faster or slower.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then the bright lights are gone and she feels alone. Very
alone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But she isn't. She hears voices around her, drifting,
echoing, and she tries to understand what they are saying.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She's stabilized. We're past the critical phase.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do you want to bring her up now?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Not yet. We still don't know how it's going to
go.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There was a pause, and then a male voice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This was the Beta too, wasn't it, Karl?&quot; Another
pause. &quot;Well, wasn't it? The injections. That's the first time since . .
.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Again the voices drift off. She listens, not sure what she is
hearing. She tries to process the word &quot;beta&quot; but makes no headway.
In computer slang, &quot;beta&quot; means a program that is still being tested.
Then she remembers hearing the word just hours earlier. She had been talking to
some woman. But she can't remember who—“ </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I changed the procedure this time,&quot; comes a voice.
&quot;I injected the special Beta enzyme separately from the activated stem
cells. Whatever happens will happen at the enzyme's own pace now. And I kept
the dosage as low as I could. We'll be monitoring her telomerase levels
throughout the day. If there's no rejection, we will be past the first
phase.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is the dosage the only difference from before?&quot; comes
the other, accusing voice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;At this point, </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
 color:windowtext'>David</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>,
manipulating the Beta is an art, not a science. I'm just attempting to create
antigens, the way a smallpox vaccination does. Then we'll try to harvest them.
This is not really a full&#8209;scale Beta procedure. I don't plan to do that
ever again.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There was another long silence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That man who was here with her. Her cousin, did he say?
I saw no family resemblance, but he seemed very upset.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's why I had him sent upstairs. I think he's the
reporter W.B. was so concerned about. Anyway, he's gone.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Stone. She realizes that's who they're talking about. And now
he's gone. She's on her own.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Next the voices drift away for a time, into some echo space
that mutes them. Finally, though, they come back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This should be adequate for another four hours. After
that, you'll need a glucose IV to keep her hydrated.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've already put it on her chart. By then we should
have some idea of which way this is going. I'm thinking, I'm praying, that this
time is going to be the charm. That I've learned how to modulate the
enzyme.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Is she ready for transfer to IC?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Anytime.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The voices start drifting away. A fuzziness is enveloping her
senses, leaving everything soft and muted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The pain is gone from her body now, and the bright lights
around her seem to be dimming. The figures in the white haze on the perimeter
are now disappearing, one by one, as though filing out of a room. And now she
feels like she's floating, with things moving past her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then, finally, one lone voice is talking to her, is really
talking to her, in a private and unmistakable way. And as she drifts back into
the gulf of anesthesia, she listens to words that do not make a lot of sense.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The Fountain. Through all the ages, we've been looking
in the wrong place. It's within us. Together, Alexa, we have this chance.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She listens as the voice begins to drift away. Yet she feels
a genuine sense of closeness to it. She realizes she no longer has control of
her destiny. But still she wants to be where she is.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now the sea is coming back, flowing around her, and she tries
to remember where she is and why, but all she is aware of is the sea rising,
until she is engulfed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>8:00<span
style='text-transform:uppercase'> a.m.</span></span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Stone awoke in his Yorkville apartment nursing a hangover and
a lot of regrets. He'd inhaled a triple scotch after driving Ally's Toyota back
and parking it on the street the night before. He'd needed it. Yesterday had
been a day where, in sequential order, he'd seen a woman who'd lost her memory
get kidnapped (probably); he'd been fired from his day job; he'd finally gotten
inside the Dorian Institute, only to blow the opportunity completely. But the
most important thing that happened was, he'd rediscovered a woman he'd once
been in love with and he currently didn't have the slightest idea what was
happening to her. Thinking back over their last few moments together, when she
was being checked in by Van de Vliet and his research team and he was being
hastily sent up to the lobby, Stone suspected that Ally was about to be
subjected to something they didn't want anybody to know about.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now he was determined to get back inside the institute and
look out for her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he pulled himself out of bed and shakily made his way</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>into the
kitchen to start the coffee, he was trying to decide where to begin. As it
happened he now had all the time in the world</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He didn't mind all that much losing his position at the
Sentinel—come on, that was writ across the sky—but he particularly regretted
being denied the pleasure of quitting on his own terms, complete with a
flamboyant fuck&#8209;you&#8209; very&#8209;much farewell speech to the
managing editor, Jay. He'd actually been rehearsing it for weeks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The dream of just showing up at the Dorian Institute and
walking in was no longer even a fantasy. There was a special &quot;not
welcome&quot; mat out for him. Even more than the first time, he'd need a
calling card.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That had to be Kristen Starr. She clearly held the key to
whatever it was Winston Bartlett and Karl Van de Vliet were trying to cover up.
But how to find her? The only real lead he had was the apartment she'd come
back to, apparently returning like a genetically programmed salmon going back
upstream but not really knowing why.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Okay, why not go back down there and look around again, only
do it thoroughly? He and Ally hadn't had time to do much more than a cursory
look&#8209;around. The specter of the knives in the walls still haunted him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But how to get in?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he remembered that Ally had been given the key by
Kristen's spacey subtenant, Cindy, the one who was renting the ground&#8209;floor
apartment. Did she leave that key at her CitiSpace office or did she put it on
her key ring?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Her car keys were lying on the table by the door, where he'd
tossed them last night. He walked over and checked them out. There were several
house keys on the ring in addition to her Toyota keys. Could she have put
Kristen's key on the ring too? Or did she stash it in her desk at CitiSpace?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Swing by the apartment and try these, he decided Maybe I'll
get lucky.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he headed for the shower, a cup of black Jamaican coffee
in hand, he thought again about the last thing Alexa's good&#8209;for&#8209;nothing
brother, Grant, had said, something about how Alexa was their &quot;best
shot.&quot; Whatever that meant, it couldn't be good.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>By nine o'clock he had showered, shaved, and was in Ally's
Toyota headed for West Eleventh Street. As he turned right on Fourteenth, he
had a fresh idea.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Kristen's phone was still working, at least as of yesterday.
So did she have speed dial, a memory bank of numbers? That could be a gold mine
of the people closest to her. But if not, there were other tricks, ways of
getting phone information. There might even be information in the phone itself:
who do you get on &quot;redial&quot; and who do you get with *69, the last
number that dialed in?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The last number that dialed in would probably be the Japanese
guy who left a message and then kidnapped her. But the last call out could be
interesting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He had a nagging feeling that this wasn't the best way to be
spending his morning, but he couldn't immediately think of anything else.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>West Eleventh Street was comparatively empty, so he had no
trouble securing a parking space. After he'd turned off the engine, he looked
at Ally's key set again. Well, there were four other keys on it besides the
Toyota keys. Give it a shot.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He got out and locked the car and walked up the steps. It was
a perfect spring morning, cool and crisp, and this part of the Village was
quiet and residential. He found himself envying the owners of these beautiful
nineteenth&#8209;century town houses. There was something so dignified and
secure about them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he saw a man emerge from the apartment below the stoop,
just a few feet from where he was standing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hi. How's Cindy?&quot; he called down, hoping the
social gesture would let the guy know he wasn't about to do a second&#8209;
story number on Kristen's town house.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The man, who looked to be in his late twenties, was dressed
in a black suit, with long blond hair tied back in a ponytail, and carried a
shoulder bag that appeared to be serving as a briefcase. He stared at Stone
with a puzzled look.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I was here yesterday and . . . a woman named Cindy,
friend of Kristen's, said she was leasing the garden apartment. I was just
wondering—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm sorry. Maybe you have the wrong address. I've had
this place for almost a year and a half now.&quot; He was moving on down the
street as he called back over his shoulder. &quot;Good luck.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What the hell is going on?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He looked up and checked the number. Yep, it's 217. Cindy had
definitely gone into that apartment yesterday and talked convincingly about
living there and working at the E! station. She even had keys to Kristen's
place.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So who the hell was that guy? He looked back, but now he had
disappeared.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Did I just imagine that? he puzzled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He moved up the steps to the heavy white wood door and
started trying keys.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The first one wouldn't enter the lock, nor would the second.
The third key entered but would not turn.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Okay, last chance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He inserted the fourth and it seemed to stick. But he gave it
a wiggle and <i>voila</i>, he was in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Thanks, Ally.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>But when he stepped through the door and switched on
the light, he could only stare in disbelief. The apartment had been completely
cleared out. The white walls, which had been covered with knifed photos of
Kristen only yesterday, were now blank. Even the few pieces of furniture were
gone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Jesus, I don't believe this.&quot; His voice echoed off
the empty marble mantelpiece and bounced across the room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He looked around. Since late yesterday, somebody had come in
and cleaned out the place. Thoroughly. Any hopes of finding old letters, an
address book, anything personal, were gone. He knew immediately that he had
been outsmarted. Kristen Starr, and now her friend Cindy, had officially ceased
to exist. Cindy might still be at E!, but she was going to be terrified and
subject to massive memory loss on the subject of Kristen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But wait a second. They left the phone. The answering machine
is gone, but maybe they didn't realize that phones can have memories and can
sometimes tell tales. That might be worth a try, but check out the place first.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He walked into the kitchen alcove and gazed around, not
entirely sure what he was looking for. The main thing would be some phone
numbers and addresses.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He opened the refrigerator and peered in. It was still
running and contained two unopened jars of British marmalade and an empty quart
jar with traces of orange juice bordered by mold. The freezer compartment was
entirely bare.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The two kitchen cabinets above the stove had been similarly
emptied. He gave them a cursory look, then came back and followed a hallway to
a bathroom in the back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When he opened the medicine chest above the sink and peered
in, he initially thought it was empty, with a pile of wadded&#8209;up Kleenex
on the bottom shelf. He was pulling that out when he realized that the tissue
had been wadded around an empty prescription drug vial.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Kristen Starr had prescription number 378030. It was for
Libinol—whatever that was, probably some kind of screwed&#8209;up diet pill—and
it had been filled five months ago. It had been delivered from Grove Pharmacy
on Seventh Avenue to here, 217 West Eleventh Street. The address was pasted on
a sticker on the back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hmmm, he thought. After she left, rather than transferring
the prescription, what if they just had subsequent refills delivered to some
other address? There's a long shot that Grove Pharmacy might have a new address
for the prescription number. Okay, it would be a very long shot, but still . .
.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Unless, of course, her new address had been the Dorian
Institute. In that case, the prescription would undoubtedly have</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>been
discontinued once she became a patient. He reached for his cell phone to call
the drugstore.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Shit, I forgot it! Damn hangover.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He walked back into the living room and stared at Kristen's
phone. If it was still working, he could call Grove Pharmacy and—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No, idiot, that would wipe out any number stored in the
redial function. Without a cell, the best thing to do is just go over there and
check with the pharmacist in person.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He settled yoga&#8209;style onto the hardwood floor next to
the phone and stared at it. What if the line is already disconnected? Why did
whoever cleaned this place out leave it here? The phone, of all things. It's—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It rang.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He jumped a foot off the floor, and then stared at it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A series of reasons flashed through his mind:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>1)They know I'm here and they're going to warn me again to
back off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>2)They know I'm here and the last incoming call here was from
a number they don't want me to know about. I pick this up and I wipe out any
chance of ever finding out what it was.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Don't answer it. This phone call is not intended to be
helpful.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Not picking up the phone was the hardest thing he'd ever
done, but he was determined to be disciplined.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He counted eleven rings and then he couldn't take it anymore
and reached for the receiver.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It stopped.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Thank God.&quot; His hand froze in midair. The timing
had been a split&#8209;second salvation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>All right, he thought, time to find out if I just totally
screwed up. Time to dial.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He got his pen and notebook poised and then lifted the black
receiver. He knew from the message on her machine yesterday that somebody had
called her just before he got there. Or maybe whoever came and cleaned out her
apartment had received a phone call while they were here. Possibly from whoever
sent them. A checkup call.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Who knew? But give it a shot. He hit the code.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A mechanical voice came on immediately: &quot;Your last call
was from area code 212, number 555&#8209;3935. If you would like for me to
connect you, please push—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Go for it,&quot; he said aloud, scribbling down the
number and then following the instruction.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At that moment somebody's cell phone began to ring just
outside the front door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Oh shit.&quot; It was just too big a coincidence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After two rings it stopped and he heard the voice of Winston
Bartlett, both outside the front door and in his ear.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was too startled to respond, but he didn't need to,
because an instant later he also heard the sound of a key and then the front
door opened.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A shaft of daylight shot across the room as Bartlett took one
look and exploded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Damn, so it's true. How the hell did—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, come on in,&quot; Stone said, trying to recover
some poise and take marginal control of the situation. &quot;I'm here by
permission. The downstairs tenant, who you just evicted, or kidnapped too, gave
me her key.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You don't get it, do you? I told you to keep—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But we have signs of progress. I know all about
Kristen.&quot; Well, that was hardly the case, but it never hurt to start off
with a bluff to see how far you could get. &quot;That's why I'm here. The
question is, when are we going to start talking to each other? Because I'm
putting together a hell of a story.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't fucking believe this.&quot; Bartlett slammed
the door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;By the way, a special thanks for getting me sacked at
the Sentinel. Now I'll have the leisure to concentrate full&#8209;time on the
stem cell book. And Gerex.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I warned you, but you wouldn't fucking listen.&quot; He
was peering around the living room as though searching for clues to explain why
nothing was going right.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Like I said, I talked to Kristen yesterday.&quot; Stone
stood his ground. &quot;She's not a happy person.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If you bring her into this . . .&quot; Bartlett glared
at him. &quot;I can't imagine what makes you think you can just run roughshod
through my business and my life.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Here's how it is. You can abuse me, or you can use me.
Keep in mind I'm accustomed to working for people who buy ink by the barrel. As
I tried to explain before, if you won't let me get at the whole truth, I may
end up spreading half&#8209;truths.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Bartlett walked across the room and ran his fingers along the
marble mantelpiece above the fireplace. &quot;You know,&quot; he said, turning
back, &quot;up until now you've never asked me for anything. I have to say I've
always admired that, but I'm curious why.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe I thought it was you</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>r place</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> to come to me,&quot; Stone said, puzzled
by the left turn the conversation had suddenly taken. &quot;You know, I have a
life of my own. I have an eleven&#8209; year&#8209;old daughter you've never
seen or—apparently—care to see. I'm wondering what that says about you. Your
granddaughter's name, by the way, is—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I know her name. I know quite a bit about our blood
ties, or lack of.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, I'd bet she'd be just thrilled by that.
Incidentally, she doesn't know a goddam thing about you and I'd just as soon
keep it that way.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I knew having this conversation was a fucking mistake.
This is why I never had it. Any real son of mine has got to have some of my
character, my stature. You're a bean counter.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If you had any character, you wouldn't be hiding behind
all this secrecy. I try to tell the truth, as much and as often as I can.
That's my take on character.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What we're doing at Gerex is going to change the
history of the world. We're at the brink of things mankind has only dreamed
about. And I've taken all the risks. In fact, I took the biggest risk of all
personally. There's a lot going on that you don't know a damned thing about.
We're on the edge of—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All the more reason you should want the whole story
told,&quot; Stone interjected. &quot;Yes, stem cell technology is going to
change everything, but you can't just tell half the story. I want it to work,
but I'm a truth seeker. I want to find out what, if anything, can go wrong too.
You've been using people, first Kristen and now—I'm beginning to fear—Ally, to
take your risks for you. I mean, what's going on? Why did you send somebody
down to obliterate all evidence of Kristen? And now Cindy, that girl
downstairs? My God, she's somehow vanished too. Whatever happened to Kristen to
make it come to this?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What may or may not have gone wrong is nothing that
can't be made right. No great medical advance ever succeeded in a direct
line.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't need the sales pitch,&quot; Stone said. &quot;I
agree it's going to revolutionize medicine. But you can't—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's why you'll never be a son of mine. You always
think small. This is about more than mere medicine. It's about doing the one
thing mankind has never been able to do. I am this close. Nothing is going to
be allowed to destroy this chance. Not even you, my own flesh and blood.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Am I that?&quot; Stone asked, feeling an unexpected
satisfaction. &quot;Your own 'flesh and blood'?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That is something,&quot; Bartlett said, &quot;we are
about to discover. Whether we are made of the same thing. The best way for you
to understand what's going on here is to do what I've done. Have the Beta
procedure. Show me you've got the balls.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The 'Beta procedure'? It might help if I knew what it
is.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why don't I just show you,&quot; Bartlett said.
&quot;You want to be on the inside, see everything up close? Fine. I think the
time has come. You seem determined to stick your nose into what I'm doing. You
weaseled your way into the institute, and now you show up here. So I guess it's
time you were an insider all the way.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Good, maybe then I can start getting some answers. For
example, was changing Kristen's name part of the NIH study?&quot; Stone turned
to face him. &quot;Or is it your way to hide one of your mistakes?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Quite frankly, that's none of your goddam
business.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, let me tell you what is my business. Ally Hampton
is a particular friend of mine. I damned well want to know whether she's
scheduled to undergo the same procedure as Kristen. I don't know what you and
Van de Vliet did to Kristen, but if you turn Ally into a zombie too, I'll
personally—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think we'll continue this discussion later.&quot; He
pulled his cell phone out of a jacket pocket, flipped it open, and punched a
memory number.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ken, could you and Jake please come in. We have the
problem I was afraid we had.&quot; He flipped the phone shut and turned back to
Stone. &quot;Karl entered Ms. Hampton and her mother into the clinical trials at
the last minute, as a special favor. She's in no danger.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now Stone saw two men come through the front door. One was
the tall Japanese man who had slugged him the day before.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Shit. I need this? Is he going to work me over again?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The other guy was dressed in white, as though he were an
orderly or nurse. Stone noticed he had a plastic syringe in his right hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ken, could you and Jake please take care of this. He'll
be going with us.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Stone examined the three of them. Well, he thought, / guess
I'm going to be back inside the Dorian Institute after all.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Look, there's no need for excessive violence here. We
could just set some ground rules for this situation.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Japanese man named Ken walked over and seized him around
the neck, while at the same time pulling his right arm around behind him, a
decisive hammerlock.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You fucker,&quot; Stone choked out. &quot;Let—&quot;
The man Bartlett had called Jake, the one in white, shoved a needle into his
arm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This could be the experience you've been looking
for,&quot; Bartlett said. &quot;You've been pursuing me like a dog chasing a
car. Now we're about to see if you're man enough to handle the consequences
when you've caught it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>You're damned right I'll handle it, he tried to say. But he
wasn't sure if he actually got it said, the void was closing in so fast.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>10:33<span
style='text-transform:uppercase'> p.m.</span></span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Grant, is that you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally squinted in the semi&#8209;dark of the room, finally
making out the silhouette. He was sitting in a chair beside her bed, and his
face was troubled, reminding her of when he'd had a bad day in high school.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Am I dreaming again? she puzzled. The clock on the wall told
her that this was a late hour for whatever he was up to now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's me,&quot; he said, his voice low, just above a
whisper. The door behind him, she noticed, was shut. &quot;Welcome back to the
world. They moved you upstairs just for tonight. This is the first chance I've
had to get near you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was still wondering where she was, what day it was. The
walls were an icy blue, illuminated only by the silver&#8209; and&#8209;green
glow of the bank of CRT screens that now monitored her heart and her
respiration. She lifted her head off the pillow and for a moment, looked past
Grant, examining the screen of the heart monitor. It was a phonocardiogram.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She knew what to look for. Over the years she'd learned to
interpret every irregular pulse, every errant amplitude, but now the sonic
abnormalities that typically characterized her stenosis, the struggle of her
heart's scarred valve to maintain adequate coronary output, were significantly
damped.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There'd always been murmurs, abnormal heart sounds, as long
as she could remember, so what did this mean? Had the damaged valve already
begun restoring and strengthening itself? While she slept?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Or was this just more of some dream?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Why was she in this hospital anyway, hooked up to monitors?
She still couldn't remember exactly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What . . .?&quot; She tried to rise up out of the bed.
Again she wondered, was Grant real or some chimera?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then she realized she was strapped in, though the straps were
held only with black Velcro.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As she started to pull them open, she noticed she had an IV
needle in her arm, with a plastic tube that led to a bag of liquid suspended
from a hook above her head. More annoying, however, was the checkerboard of taped&#8209;on
sensors on her upper body, for the ongoing phonocardiogram. She looked at all
the tubes and connected wires and felt like a laboratory animal in the middle
of an experiment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ally, you're at the Dorian Institute, remember? Dr. Van
de Vliet's stem cell clinical trials. Nina's here too.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Oh.&quot; That rang a bell, sort of. &quot;What . . .
what day is it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He told her. &quot;You've been under sedation since late
yesterday, Ally. But Dr. Vee says your test data show you're responding—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mom's here, right?&quot; Now things were starting to
come back. &quot;How's she doing? Is she—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He's talking about discharging her by the end of next
week, even before the NIH clinical trials are officially over.&quot; Grant
tried a smile. &quot;By then, he thinks the procedure will have replaced enough
tissue in her brain that she might not even need a caregiver. She's doing
crosswords again. Need I say more.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My God.&quot; Now she remembered how on&#8209;again,
off&#8209;again Nina's mind had been when she brought her out to the institute.
Had she really been given a second chance? And so quickly? If so, it was truly
astonishing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But now she found herself staring at Grant, mesmerized.
Something about him seemed oddly off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Grant, what... what's going on with you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've . . .&quot; He was hesitating. &quot;I've been
thinking about everything. Now I really wish I hadn't done what I did.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; This kind of
revisionist remorse didn't sound like the Grant she knew.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Have you seen Kristen? They said you know about her,
were asking about her.&quot; Then he stepped back. &quot;Do you know about
her?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Kristen. She tried to remember. Is that the woman everybody .
. . Her mother had come to the institute with a pistol trying to find her? Then
she was kidnapped. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's the Syndrome,&quot; Grant went on. &quot;She
wanted the Beta procedure, and Dr. Vee finally agreed. But nobody expected
anything to happen like what eventually did. That's why W.B. went ahead and had
it too.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Beta. Now she remembered that Kristen had mumbled something
about that word.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ally, I got you into . . . When I told W. B. that I
thought you and he had the same rare blood type, AB, he wanted to bring you
into the program.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You mean for my heart?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He looked away and his eyes grew pained. &quot;Well, that's
part of it. There's another part they haven't told you about.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What's that?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Antibodies. They think there's a chance you could be
made to develop them and then they could use them to help W.B. He doesn't have
the Syndrome yet, but it's probably just a matter of time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What, she puzzled, is he talking about? What &quot;antibodies
&quot;? What &quot;syndrome &quot;? She was weak and she wasn't sure her mind
was fully functional. But after what appeared to be</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>the miracle
of her heart, she was willing to forsake a certain amount of momentary
rationality.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then more memory started returning. &quot;Kristen. What about
her? I saw—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ally, the Syndrome started with her over four months
ago. At first they didn't fully realize how serious . . . but now it's getting
worse every day.&quot; He paused and turned away. &quot;Look, I've been
thinking. I'm really sorry that I brought you into this. What if something goes
wrong?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If you could see Kristen now, you'd understand.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Where is she? Is she still wherever they're hiding
her?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No.&quot; He turned back. &quot;Kristen . . . After
what happened yesterday, she had to be brought back out here. There's a ward
downstairs, on the floor below the offices and lab, that's kind of like an
intensive&#8209;care unit. That's where you were until tonight. But you can't
go back down there on your own. Not even the nurses can go without a special
authorization, which is never given.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But if Kristen is—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ally, you 're the one I'm worried about. I thought what
they were going to do to you was safe. But last night I. . . I heard them all
talking and I think you could be in serious danger. They don't actually know
what the consequences of what they're doing will be. You need to get out of
here and at least get the real story. I don't want this on my hands.
Truthfully, there could be some deep legal shit coming out of all this. I can
think of at least three felonies. I don't want any part of that liability, and
I want you to testify that I got you out of here if it ever comes to
that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Finally the straight story, she thought. He's afraid he's
about to be an accomplice in a criminal conspiracy. He's getting cold feet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Grant, do something for me. Get me unplugged. All these
sensors. I want to go see her for myself.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ally, forget it. To begin with, I can't unplug you.
Only a</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>nurse can do
that. And I don't want to. You've got catheters in places I—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then I'll get a nurse to come and do it. I'll say I
need to go to the bathroom. That should get me unhooked.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Annoyed she looked around. Where's the buzzer? There has to
be one somewhere. Then she spotted a set of controls attached to the bed and
sure enough, there was a red button. What else could it be?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She pushed it and a light came on above her door. Moments
later, a short blue&#8209;haired woman with the name<span style='text-transform:
uppercase'> marion</span> sewn into her white uniform opened the door and came
striding in, flicking on the fluorescent overheads.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My, my, we're looking well,&quot; she declared ignoring
Grant. &quot;I'm glad you're finally awake. He told us to call him the minute
... They're all saying you and your mother must have special genes. You've both
been such terrific patients. He'd been keeping you sedated but he discontinued
that medication this afternoon. He wanted you to wake up with your mind
clear.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, I'd really like to get up and go to the bathroom
and get something to eat,&quot; Ally said &quot;Mainly, I just want to get out
of this bed for a stretch before I start developing bedsores. I'm feeling
strong, for now at least. Can you unhook some of these wires and suction cups?
And I certainly don't need that IV. I'm so hungry I could inhale a quart of ice
cream in one gulp.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, of course,&quot; Marion said and began dismantling
the intravenous tubes. &quot;We only monitor you and hydrate you when you're
not conscious. The standard procedure is to let you get up and start getting
some exercise as soon as possible. You should be careful, though, because at
this point you're not as strong as you think. Changes are taking place in your
body that require a lot of your energy. If you feel up to it, you could walk
around for a couple of minutes, but you shouldn't let yourself get tired.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Marion continued now removing the taped&#8209;on sensors,
Ally looked up and saw another uniformed nurse standing in the doorway. She
also was middle&#8209;aged, with prematurely gray hair, and she was holding a
syringe.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;May I come in?&quot; she asked. &quot;At this stage he
needs a blood sample every three hours. Just twenty cc's.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally watched as the new nurse quickly and deftly took a small
sample of blood. Then she capped it off and turned to leave.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I need to centrifuge this immediately.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And she was gone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then Marion finished removing the IV tube and catheter and
all the taped&#8209;on electrodes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If you want to get up and use the bathroom and walk
around a little, I'm sure it would be all right. I'll come back in a few
minutes and bring you a tray with a nice healthy bowl of broth.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The moment she was out the door, Ally turned to Grant.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I want to see Kristen. Now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I thought the first thing you wanted was to go to the
bathroom.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll get to that. You said she was downstairs
somewhere. How do I get there?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's in the security zone,&quot; he said. &quot;You're
not authorized—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're a big shot around here. Winston Bartlett's right&#8209;hand
flunky. So why don't you authorize me yourself.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ally, you know I can't do that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then take me there.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't want to see Kristen anymore,&quot; he declared,
biting his lip. &quot;She's completely lost . . . everything. I could deal with
it until I saw her this morning. It's just too much.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Has he let her mother see her?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Are you kidding? Letting that psycho anywhere near her
is the last thing anybody's going to do.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2>&quot;Then get me in, dammit.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ally, forget about it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He hesitated, as though marshaling his thoughts.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sis,&quot; he said finally, &quot;there're only so many
risks I can take for you, and they have to be about something that matters.
Forget about Kristen. Nothing can save her now. But I'm offering to help you
get out of here before they go any further. I can't be seen helping you, but
they've started you down a road that you don't want to go, believe me. I got
you into this, but if there's still time, I want to try to help get you
out.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She didn't know what was going on, but if Grant of all people
was freaked about what Karl Van de Vliet had in store for her, then maybe she'd
better take it seriously.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But she was through relying on him for anything.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Okay, but I want to call somebody to come and get
me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Are you referring to that reporter, by any
chance?&quot; he asked. &quot;The guy who drove you here? W.B. hates him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes.&quot; She was puzzled that he would know about
Stone. &quot;How do you—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Bartlett has him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He's radioactive now. I actually kicked him out of here
myself yesterday. This is not a moment for press freedom. He could screw up
everything. W.B. said he's doing a book. No way is that guy going to be allowed
human contact with anybody till the sale of Gerex is in the bank. He had a run&#8209;in
with Bartlett in the city and they took him somewhere. I don't know the
location. And I don't want to know.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Oh my God.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He's most likely okay. It's just temporary
safekeeping.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All the more reason I'm not leaving till I see
Kristen.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There's no way you're going to get into where they're
keeping her, Ally.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All right.&quot; There was no arguing with him when he
was this freaked. &quot;What do you want me to do?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He pulled a plastic card out of his jacket pocket. It was
white, with<span style='text-transform:uppercase'> the gerex corporation</span>
embossed on one side and a magnetic strip on the other.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This is a master key to this place. Because of
security, you can't just go out the front, through the lobby. But if you take
the elevator down to the first floor of the basement, where the lab is, there's
a fire exit there, in the back, that opens onto a path down to the lake. If
you'll go out that door and wait right there, I'll come around and get you to
the parking lot. I know a way that will miss their surveillance cameras. I'm
scheduled to go back to the city now and I'll take you with me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But if I wanted to see Kristen?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You'd have to go into the laboratory and then take the
elevator that's inside there. Don't even think about it. It's way too
risky.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She looked at him, trying to gauge his sincerity. Had he
become a new man, finally caring about somebody other than himself? Or had a
glimpse of whatever had happened to Kristen scared the hell out him and
awakened the specter of being part of a felonious enterprise?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why are you doing this?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;To make up for a few things,&quot; he said, turning to
leave.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>With that, he walked out and quietly closed the door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That remains to be seen, she told herself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She went to the bathroom, then put on a bathrobe and headed
out into the hallway. The nurse's station was not occupied. Marion was still in
the kitchen on the first floor, presumably.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Good.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was feeling shaky, not nearly as strong as she'd
initially thought she was, but she pressed on, taking the elevator, her first
use of Grant's Gerex master key. She bypassed the first floor and an instant
later she was stepping into the basement's laboratory area.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At the moment it appeared to be entirely deserted, though the
fluorescent lights bathed the space in a stark, pitiless light.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Down the
hall was Dr. Van de Vliet's office and the examining room, where she and her
mother had gone when they were being admitted. At this time of night,
everything was closed and probably locked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She turned and looked at the forbidding entryway to the glass&#8209;enclosed
laboratory. Through the transparent walls she could see the dim glow of CRT
screens and incubators filled with petri dishes. And there at the back
was—could her eyes be trusted?—the outline of an elevator door. She hadn't noticed
it until this minute. It seemed to be built with a nod toward camouflage.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It could lead to Kristen, she told herself. Find out what
Grant is so freaked about. He can wait a couple of minutes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was starting to feel even weaker, but she pressed on. Next
to the heavy steel, high&#8209;security air lock leading into the laboratory
was a card reader and she swiped the white card through the slot.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The air lock opened silent and perfunctory. When she went
through, the door behind her automatically closed and then the hermetically
sealed door in front of her opened. She was in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Next a bright fluorescent light clicked on, all by itself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Jesus!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Maybe it was connected to a motion sensor. Or on a timer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then she looked around. This, she thought, is the place where
the Gerex Corporation has supposedly changed medical history. What was created
in this very room had if Grant was telling the truth, saved her mother's
sanity. And if she could believe the monitors she had looked at in her room,
her own heart condition had begun to be reversed after a lifetime of
progressive decline.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Yet something about it had been pushed too far. Somewhere in
the midst of this miracle, the Gerex Corporation had done something so obscene
no one could even talk about it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She looked around the laboratory, wishing she could
understand what she was seeing. It smelled like solvent, acetone, with a
mingling of more pungent fumes. The black slate laboratory workbenches were
spotlessly hygienic and equipped with several large microscopes that featured
flat&#8209;panel screens. She noticed a heavy server computer at the back,
presumably networked to all the terminals in the building, and then she
remembered that Van de Vliet had once spoken of computer simulations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Someday soon, she told herself, she was going to understand
what really was going on here, but for now she headed for the elevator.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Another zip of Grant's white card and the door opened. There
was indeed a floor below the laboratory, and she pushed the button. The Dorian
Institute was all about security, but this subbasement area was doubly secure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After a quick trip down, the elevator door opened onto
another air lock chamber, this an exit from the pressurized environment of the
laboratory.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Why, she wondered, had no one spotted her yet? Perhaps this
part of the clinic was such a lockdown that nurses and guards weren't
necessary.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As she stepped from the air lock, she was in a hallway. She
walked down and tried the first unmarked door. It was locked, but then she saw
the slot for her card. She slipped it in and the door opened automatically.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The room she entered had a row of beds, each shrouded in a
curtain. As she walked down the center aisle, she realized that only one of the
beds was occupied.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And, yes, it was Kristen. She was lying there and when Ally
slid back the curtain, her eyes clicked open, startled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hi, don't be afraid. I'm a friend.&quot; She quietly
finished drawing the curtain aside.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now the once&#8209;breezy Kristen Starr was staring at her
with angry eyes, the false bravado of a frightened child. And she looked much
younger than she had in the head shot she'd attached to the walls of her town
house with steak knives. She said nothing for a moment; then she mouthed,
&quot;Who are you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I talked to you on the phone a couple of days
ago,&quot; Ally said, not sure herself exactly when it was, &quot;when you went
down to you</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>r place</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> on West Eleventh Street.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't know you,&quot; she mouthed again, this time
with a slight whisper.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My name is Ally Hampton.&quot; She moved next to her so
she could keep her voice down. &quot;I'm an interior designer. I once did an
apartment for you in Chelsea.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm about to go on a journey,&quot; she whispered.
&quot;I don't remember you, but maybe you're the one who's going with me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There was something otherworldly and chilling about her
voice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What journey do you—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We were going to go away. That's what he promised. Just
us two. Well, I'm ready. I want to go out and play. But he doesn't care
anymore. He just wants me to disappear. So that's what I'll do. Only we'll do
it together, you and me.&quot; She reached up from her bed and ran a finger
across Ally's face. &quot;Will you take me out of here? He promised me
everything, that I could get it all back. But now I know he didn't care. He was
just using me.&quot; She stopped, then gave a cruel laugh from the back of her
throat. &quot;But now it's going to happen to him too. I can tell. That's why
he doesn't want to see me anymore. He doesn't want to see what's in store for
him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What has happened? Ally wondered. It sounds like some kind of
bizarre experiment gone wrong.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Won't you come with me?&quot; Kristen went on.
&quot;We'll go to a place nobody has ever been to before. It'll be just
us.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Her seductive eyes, at once plaintive and demanding, would
have lured anyone toward wherever she wanted to go. For a careless moment Ally
found herself wanting to follow them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No, this is madness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Or, Ally thought with horror, is she seeing something in me
that I can't see?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Kristen, listen to me. Please. I think it's very
possible I've just had a stem cell procedure. For my heart. I don't know if
it's like what you had, but I want to know what happened to you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't do it,&quot; she mumbled, seeming to come back to
a kind of reality. &quot;Just get out of here now. After . . . it starts, he
gives you shots and things, but nothing works.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally felt her consciousness start to wobble. She reached out
and seized the edge of the bed for support.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Kristen, talk to me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Her eyes went blank again, and Ally could just barely make
out what she mumbled next. In fact, all she could catch were random words,
words that only drifted through her consciousness and failed to stick or make
any sense. It was as though Kristen were in a stance and sleepwalking among the
words of some alien language.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Young,&quot; Kristen seemed to say. &quot;You want to
be . . . to stay. Old is so horrible. Time. You're young and then suddenly
you're old and it turns out you can't . . .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally heard the words, but they didn't make any sense.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm sorry, Kristen. I'm feeling a little dizzy.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's started,&quot; she said, abruptly coherent again
and focusing in on Ally. &quot;That's how it began with me. At first they said
everything was okay and then it wasn't.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's happening throughout my body.&quot; She sobbed.
&quot;I've stopped having periods and I'm getting acne. Everything is . . .
changing.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The words drifted through space, and Ally felt like she was
hallucinating, in a place where time was sliding sideways. The images were all
retro, things from her past that floated through her vision in reverse
chronological order.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was it. In her mind, time was going backwards. But was
it just in her mind? She looked again at Kristen and gasped. Finally, finally
she understood the horror of what was really happening. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Oh my God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I got here as soon as I could after they called
me,&quot; came a voice from the doorway. She turned and saw Karl Van de Vliet,
together with the nurse Marion. &quot;You really shouldn't be down here. I
don't know who gave you a card. But we've brought a wheelchair. You really
should be resting.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Marion rolled the chair through the door and expertly plucked
the card from the reader.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Now, please sit down,&quot; she said. &quot;We all just
want to be on the safe side, don't we? I'll need to give you a sedative.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally looked at Van de Vliet, wanting to strangle him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, you're not giving me a damned sedative. I don't
want to be on the 'safe side.' I want the truth. And I want it now.&quot;</span></p>

color:windowtext'>&quot;Let's go into the lab to talk,&quot; Van de Vliet said.
&quot;I'm very sorry I wasn't here when you came out of sedation. But Marion
called me at home, as I'd told her to do, and I came in as quickly as I could.
I've got a place on the lake, just down the road, so I'm never far away.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was rolling her through the air lock door, Marion behind
them. Then they took the elevator up. She was furious that Kristen was being
left behind like an abandoned casualty of war.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally also was reminding herself about her appointment with
Grant to get the hell out. But her mind was having trouble holding a lot of thoughts
at once.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He pushed her wheelchair into the section of the laboratory
where a line of computer terminals was stationed. After he'd fluffed a pillow
behind her head and turned off some of the glaring fluorescents, he began.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Alexa, this is a delicate time for you. We need to get
you upstairs as quickly as possible and feed you some broth and put you back to
bed. However, I want very much to give you an update on the status of your
treatment. The headline is, it's going very well. We fused some of the
telomerase enzyme with your existing stem cells and your response was
immediate. In fact, it appears the new heart tissue has reached critical mass
and has already begun replicating itself. We've learned to expect the
unexpected around here, but your response has significantly exceeded our
simulations.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He turned to Marion and asked her to go up and make sure
Alexa's bedding had been changed. &quot;We'll be up in a second. And please
make sure that bowl of broth is ready and waiting.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After she departed through the air lock, he walked over to a
lab bench and checked the numbers that were scrolling on a CRT screen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;All right,&quot; Ally said &quot;talk to me. I just saw
Kristen. I'm still not sure if I believe what I think is happening, but I want
the real story and I want it now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's part of what I need to discuss with you.&quot;
He glanced away for a long moment, a pained expression on his face, seeming to
collect his thoughts. Finally he turned back. &quot;You see, the clinical
trials have demonstrated that we can use the telomerase enzyme to 'immortalize'
a patient's own stem cells and then rejuvenate their brain or liver or even
their heart. So the next question that's hanging out there in space is obvious.
What would happen if we could find a way to generalize the enzyme and disperse
it throughout someone's entire body, not restricting it to just one organ? And
not just rejuvenate—regenerate.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This question had actually passed fleetingly through her
consciousness, though not fully articulated. It had taken the form of wondering
where the use of these &quot;immortal&quot; cells could eventually lead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The trick would be to have just enough enzyme in your
bloodstream to replace senescent cells as they are about to the, but not so
much that healthy cells are replaced.&quot; He paused searching for a metaphor.
&quot;If we thought of the process of cell senescence as something inexorable
and steady, like a treadmill, then what we want to do is run just fast enough
to stay in one place.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This whole thing does sound like Alice in
Wonderland.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes, well . . . if we could do that, then it's
possible, just possible, that one's entire body would simply begin regenerating
itself instead of aging. Not just your skin. All of you. That's the theory
behind what we've called the Beta procedure.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But is that something you ethically ought to be
doing?&quot; she said, feeling a sense of dismay, of playing God. &quot;Isn't
that going too far?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Frankly, I'm beginning to agree with you, but there are
others who ask, how far is too far? Half the medicines we now have are intended
to trick the body's responses somehow—or to meddle in some other way, turning
off stop&#8209;and&#8209; go signals at the cellular level. For example, some
birth control pills make your body think you're already pregnant. They trick
our natural mechanisms. That kind of thing is commonplace in medicine today.
But our research is poised for the next level, to answer the question of how
long we can actually live. So here's the argument. There's no reason the human
life span has to be what it is. In some unhealthy nations the average citizen
doesn't even reach sixty. Whereas in others, like the United States and Japan,
the mean is already well past three score and ten. So what is right? What is
reasonable? A hundred? Two hundred? It's entirely possible to believe we could
live productive lives at least twice as long as we do now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And you think we should do this? The world would be
thrown into chaos.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But look at the incredible cure rate we've already
effected here using the telomerase enzyme. When our clinical trials for the NIH
are announced, it will be the medical equivalent of the shot heard round the
world. Nothing we know will ever be the same again.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That's where you should leave it. To go further is
obscene.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I fear recent events may have proved you right. Against
my better judgment, I went ahead and experimented with the Beta procedure. And
the results thus far have turned out to be disastrous.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I guess you're referring to Kristen.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;One day I casually mentioned the Beta to Winston
Bartlett and without telling me, he brought it up with Kristen. She insisted on
trying it.&quot; His expression grew increasingly pained. &quot;I want you to
know I was against it. I warned her that it was highly experimental, that I
could not guarantee what the side effects might be, but she begged me to do it
anyway. Then Bartlett essentially ordered me to do it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So what happened?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He grimaced. &quot;I got the dosage wrong. That's my best
guess. After I performed the Beta on Kristen, the enzyme was stable in her for
over two months and appeared to be having an effect. All signs of aging
abruptly stopped. It gave me a false sense of confidence. Also, there were no
side effects. That was when Bartlett wanted to try it too. So I went ahead with
him. But then, to my horror, she started evincing side effects. I now believe
the dosage I gave her was badly calibrated. It was too high—by how much I think
I've finally determined—and the enzyme eventually began replicating too
rapidly. It got away from me.&quot; He paused. &quot;What happened to Kristen,
we now call the Syndrome, for lack of a better name. And it's about to happen
to Bartlett.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But what does all this have to do with me? Why was I
brought out here with all kinds of bribes and pressure and—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do you want a simple answer? Of excruciating
honesty?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It would be helpful.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The simple answer is, Winston Bartlett has an extremely
rare blood type. It's AB. You have the same.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How did you know—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Your brother. You see, I need to try to develop
antibodies to the telomerase enzyme that won't be rejected by his immune
system. I think there's an outside chance that I could culture antibodies taken
from someone with the same blood type and use them to arrest the rampant
multiplying of telomerase enzyme about to begin in Bartlett's blood.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm here because you're using me!&quot; She couldn't
believe her ears. And Grant had set it up. No wonder he was finally feeling
guilty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I just need to borrow your immune system for a few
days. It's very safe.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't think so. I'm out of here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Actually, the procedure is already under way. While
Debra was taking your last blood sample, she also injected a minuscule amount
of the telomerase enzyme in active form, the proprietary version used in the
Beta, into your bloodstream. Don't worry. It's perfectly safe. The dosage was
so minute that there's no way it could have any effect on you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You have got to be kidding!&quot; My God, she thought,
I could sue the hell out of—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't worry, think of it like a smallpox
vaccination.&quot; He paused. &quot;Now, though, I have to tell you that I just
learned the initial dosage probably didn't do the trick. The amount of
antibodies created was, unfortunately, minuscule. Which means we need to go to
a slightly higher infusion. But again, don't worry. It's still safe.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I can't believe I'm hearing this,&quot; she said
finally, gasping for air in her fury. &quot;You didn't ask—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Alexa,&quot; he cut in, &quot;right now I have
something like two weeks left to try to head off the Syndrome in Winston
Bartlett. If we achieve that, then I'm hopeful the antibodies he creates can be
successfully used to start reversing the Syndrome in Kristen. We will know how
to manage the Beta. Who knows where that could lead? But it all begins with
you. You're the clean slate we need to start.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Before we go one step further, I want to know what,
exactly, happens with the Syndrome. I think I know, but I'd like to hear—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Something that's too bizarre to believe. It literally
defies every natural law we've ever known.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He couldn't bring himself to put it in words, she thought,
but she knew she’d guessed right the first time. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Syndrome.  Kristen Starr was growing younger. That was
the horrible development and nobody could deal with it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And they couldn't stop it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Karl Van de Vliet had created a monstrosity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I am so out of here,&quot; she said struggling to rise
from the wheelchair. &quot;If you try to keep me here, that's kidnapping. We're
talking a capital crime.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Alexa, I understand you're upset, but you're in no
condition to be discharged. I'm very sorry.&quot; He pushed a red button on a
radio device on his belt. There was genuine agony in his eyes. &quot;I've never
in my life coerced a patient in any way. But you have to understand that so
much is dependent on you now. There are no easy choices left.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He's lost control of the situation here now, she told
herself. He's truly terrified of Winston Bartlett. That's who's really got
control of my fate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Moments later, the security guard from the lobby, accompanied
by Marion, came through the door of the laboratory.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, I'm not going to let you do this,&quot; Ally
declared. &quot;I'm not letting you do any more medical experiments on
me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As she struggled again to get out of the wheelchair, she felt
a prick in her arm and saw the glint of a needle in the dim light.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm sorry, Alexa. It should all be over in just a
couple of days. And I swear no harm will come to you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was feeling her consciousness swirl as Marion began
rolling her through the steel air lock.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Stone felt his consciousness returning as the blast of an
engine cut through his sedative&#8209;induced reverie. Where was he? There were
vibrations all around him and a deafening roar that was slowly spiraling upward
in frequency and volume.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As the haze that engulfed his mind slowly began to dissipate,
he wondered if this wasn't more of the fantasy he'd been having, of flying
through some kind of multicolored space&#8209;time continuum. Or was he waking
up to something spectacularly real?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As he opened his eyes and looked around, he realized it was
no dream. He was in a cramped airline seat, strapped in with a black seat belt.
His head was gently secured to a headrest by a soft cotton scarf, but his hands
were free, lying in his lap.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Somebody had lifted him into the seat and strapped him down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>On his left was a Plexiglas window, and when he looked out,
he saw the earth beneath him begin falling away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he realized he was in a white&#8209;and&#8209;gray
helicopter that had just lifted off from a rooftop helo pad. He watched
spellbound quickly coming awake, as the craft quickly began a flight path that
circled around and past the lower end of Manhattan.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he heard the pilot speaking curtly to an air controller
somewhere and he looked up and realized it was the same samurai bastard who’d
slugged him on the street and then aided in his kidnapping.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But that had to be yesterday, or God knows how many days ago.
He was realizing he’d just lost a chunk of his life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And now he was being taken somewhere. In a very big hurry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Being up here always seems like being closer to
God&quot; came a voice from behind him. He recognized it with a jolt. It was
the man who thought he was God.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Shakily he removed the scarf that had been holding his head
and turned around. Winston Bartlett was gazing down through his own plastic
window, seemingly talking to himself.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What . . . what the hell is going on?&quot; He could
barely get the words out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Oh,&quot; Bartlett said turning to look at him.
&quot;Good I particularly wanted you to see this. It should help make my
point.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Stone struggled to comprehend what was happening. He was with
the man he had wanted to call Father for nearly four decades, whether he could
admit that to himself or not. It could be the beginning of the kind of bonding
he had always hungered for, but he didn't want it like this. They finally had a
relationship, and it was completely antagonistic. He had just been drugged and
kidnapped by his own father, this after being threatened and fired. Again,
Daddy dearest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So what was this evolving chapter about? Winston Bartlett, he
knew, could be ruthless, but he also was a visionary in his own way.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he remembered what had happened. He'd been trying to
track down Kristen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Where . . . where are we going?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We're going to the place you seem to find so
interesting,&quot; Bartlett declared over the din of the engine. &quot;But I
was hoping that we could have a rational discourse along the way. What's been
happening thus far doesn't serve either of us. I'm hoping things have cooled
down a bit and we can call a truce.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Stone was still trying to clear his head, get the cobwebs
away. It was difficult. He'd lost consciousness in a town house in the Village,
on solid ground, and regained it here, where the earth itself seemed in motion.
And now Bartlett was trying out another bargaining style, so even the rules
appeared to be in flux.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Look, down there.&quot; Bartlett was projecting through
the din around them and pointing toward the wide expanse of New York Harbor.
&quot;This McDonnell Douglas is my Zendo, my monastery, and the world below is
my contemplative garden. I come up here to find peace. This is an intersection
of the great forces of nature, one of a finite number on earth, where a mighty
river returns to the salt sea from which it came. These waters have flowed in
the same cycle for millions, billions of years, mingling, evaporating,
separating again—just as life on this planet continually replicates itself,
growing and aging and dying, but not before producing the seeds of its replacement.
How can something be at once both timeless and constantly changing? I ponder
that a lot and I always end up thinking of this river meeting the sea. Down
there, nature is a force unto itself, oblivious to good or evil, to human
desires or human laws.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Bartlett was doing a riff on some obsession of his own, Stone
decided. Or maybe it was some of the Zen philosophy that went along with
acquiring a world&#8209;class collection of samurai swords (if you believed the
published profiles).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>All the same, looking down at the sprawling city and the
harbor full of ships, it was hard not to feel omnipotent and humble at the same
time. The thing Bartlett seemed to be getting at, though, was that nature could
not be told what to do. And he seemed to be on the verge of declaring himself a
part of that unbridled natural force, also powerful enough to do whatever he
pleased.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now they were heading up the Hudson, teeming with early bird
tourist cruises and small single&#8209;masted sailboats. Bartlett paused to
take in the view with satisfaction. Finally he continued his monologue.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I know we've had our differences, but I'm prepared to
try to get past that. I want to talk to you about something I always think of
when I fly across this river. Time. I call my obsession Time and the River. Physicists
will tell you that time should be thought of as a kind of fourth dimension.
Things are always at a certain place in three dimensions, but when you describe
the location of a subatomic particle, for example, you also have to say when it
was there. To locate it accurately, you need four dimensions. We think of them
all as rigid but what if one of them could be made fluid? What if you could
alter the character of time?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In spite of himself, Stone took the bait. &quot;I don't know
what this has to do with anything. Nobody can alter the pace of time.&quot; He
found himself recalling a snippet of verse by John Donne:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>O how
feeble is man's power, </span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>That if
good fortune fall, </span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Cannot
add another hour, </span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Nor a
lost hour recall!</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Strictly speaking, that's true,&quot; Bartlett said
gravely, turning away again to stare out the Plexiglas window, down into the
morning space below them. The Hudson was now a giant ribbon of blue heading
north into the mist. &quot;But what if we could alter the clocks in our body to
make them run slower?&quot; He smiled then pointed off to his left. &quot;All
this below us has happened in a couple of hundred years. What will it look like
down there in another hundred years? Will we still need these puny machines to
fly, or will there be teleportation? Whatever it is, what would you give to be
around to see that? To have your own time slow down while the world around you
went on?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Stone was looking out into space, wondering. . . not whether
Winston Bartlett was an egomaniacal madman but rather how truly mad he really
was.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Flying in the helicopter, he felt like Faust being shown the
world by Mephistopheles. Except here Satan was his own father, offering him a
teasing prospect of what it would be like to live on and on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It would make a hell of a story. The problem was, miracles
always came with some kind of terrible price. What was the price this time?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then he had another thought. Was that what had happened to
Kristen? Was she paying the price for some kind of hubris that pushed nature
too far? Nobody had claimed she had any kind of medical condition that
necessitated a stem cell intervention. So had she been experimenting with some
other procedure? Had Mephistopheles now called in his marker?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He wanted to ask but the vibration and the noise made his
brain feel like it was in a blender.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Do you understand what I'm saying?&quot; Bartlett went
on. &quot;Do you want to be part of the most exciting development in the
history of medicine? Well, this is your chance. There is a majestic experiment
under way. But now we know it's not for the fainthearted. The question is, do
you want to live life or just write about it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think it's time I heard the whole story,&quot; Stone
said finally, forcing out the words. &quot;What's your part in this
'experiment'?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've put everything at risk, but now I'm this close to
controlling the clock. So . . . are you my son? My flesh and blood? Do you have
the balls to try it too?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Stone suspected the question was rhetorical. He was already
up to his neck in whatever was going on. He just didn’t yet know how big a part
of it he was. While he'd been sedated overnight, had they started experiments
on him?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He knew that some of the buzz about stem cells involved the
fantasy that someday they might be used to forestall the aging process.
Responsible researchers all said that they weren't trying to extend life; they
were only hoping to make a normal lifetime more livable. Rejuvenative medicine.
Winston Bartlett, however, had just taken stem cell potential to its obvious
conclusion; he was talking about doing what others did not dare. Regenerative
medicine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What would we give to be able to look forward to
thousands of mornings like this, ending it all only when we chose?&quot; he
declared his hands sweeping over the dense green beneath them. &quot;Time would
become something that merely flows endlessly through us, ever renewing. So&#8209;called
old age would cease to exist, at least for those with the courage to take the
necessary risks.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now they were moving above the pine forests that comprised
the outer ring of the Greater New York suburbs, as below them the green wilds
of New Jersey, north of the GW Bridge, were sweeping by.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Hmmm, Stone pondered if a man somehow stopped growing older
and nobody else did, at some point he'd end up being the same &quot;age &quot;
as his grandchildren. That caused him to think again about Amy and wonder if
Bartlett would ever reconcile himself to her existence. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A few minutes later, he looked down and saw a wide clearing
in the trees and a red&#8209;tile roof. They had arrived but from the air, the
Dorian Institute gave no clue to the momentous research going on inside.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Bartlett said nothing as they began their descent, and in
moments they were settling onto the rooftop landing pad. The downdraft from the
rotor cleared away a few soggy leaves, which had somehow blown there, and then
the Japanese pilot cut the power and the sound died away. When Bartlett opened
the side door, the first thing Stone noticed was the fresh, forest&#8209;scented
morning air against his face.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He found himself wondering whether the roar of the engine had
disturbed the patients, but that was almost beside the point. The Dorian
Institute was not, he now realized, merely about using stem cell technology to
heal the sick. Bartlett had been letting him know that it was also about an
experiment that was much, much more profound.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In the silence that followed, Bartlett stepped onto the pad
and lit a thin, filtered cigar. (For somebody who’d just been talking about how
long it was possible to live, the act confounded credulity.) He took a deep
drag, then tossed it onto the paving and peered back through the opening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Are you able to walk yet?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think I can manage,&quot; Stone said. He actually
wasn't sure at all. The vibrations of the chopper had done serious damage to
his sense of equilibrium.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But he did find he could take small steps. As they moved to
the stairwell leading down to the third&#8209;floor elevator, Bartlett said,
&quot;I know you've been here once before. You tried to sneak in. Grant saw you
and sent you packing. Well, this time you're here for real. The full experience.
We're going to start by taking you down to the lab and checking you in.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The man, Stone suspected, was trying to hide everything that
was going on in his mind. He wanted to talk about grandiose themes, but his
mind was really somewhere else. Beneath all the braggadocio, there was the
smell of deep, abiding fear. Winston Bartlett was in some kind of major denial.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You know, life has been good to me,&quot; Bartlett
declared as though thinking out loud. &quot;I've done and seen things most
mortals can only dream of. I'm sixty&#8209;seven, but I feel as though I've
only just begun to live. And that's what I intend to happen.&quot; He turned
back to Stone. &quot;Whether I have a son to share this with remains to be
seen.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A son? Stone glanced back at the man Bartlett had called</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Ken, who was
now shutting down the McDonnell Douglas. Maybe he was a surrogate son for
Bartlett. He was clearly a lot more than a bodyguard. He’d been the one who
nabbed Kristen and returned her to the reservation. So what did he think of
whatever was going on? Or what about Ally's brother, Grant? He'd claimed he was
the son Bartlett longed for and had never had.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Winston Bartlett already had a surfeit of sons.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When they walked through the door and into the hallway of the
third floor, it was milling with the breakfast crowd, nurses and patients, but
no one took any special notice of Winston Bartlett, the man who had made it all
possible. Did they even know who he was? Stone wondered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We're going downstairs.&quot; Bartlett directed him
toward the elevator. &quot;I'm still offering you a choice. You can be part of
the biggest medical advance in human history, or you can be just another
impediment.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Stone glanced at his watch. The hour was just shy of nine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Where is Ally? What kind of procedure has she undergone? Is
she okay? He had to find her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As they headed down, he felt like it was a descent into some
pit of no return. Winston Bartlett had not elaborated on what awaited down
there. It was as though he couldn't bring himself to face whatever it really
was.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What was the worst&#8209;case scenario at this point?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What he had to do was figure that out and then plan a
countermove.</span></p>

gliding past powerful overhead lights.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Or had she just dreamed all that? Now her life seems a
flowing river that has no beginning and no end. Her mind is drifting, a cork
bobbing helplessly in the current.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then her brother, Grant, drifts alongside her. At least she
thinks it's Grant. She recognizes his voice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ally, can you hear me?&quot; he seems to be asking.
&quot;Is there anything you want to tell me? Do you still want to go through
with this?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It's the kind of dream where she can hear things around her,
but when she tries to speak, no sounds will come. Instead, she's talking inside
her head.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>I'm afraid. I'm just afraid.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I can still try to get you out, but you have to help. I
waited for you last night but you never came.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She wants to say, yes, get me out, but she can only speak in
the dream.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now the lighting changes and she feels like she is falling.
No, she realizes, she's just on an elevator.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Talk to me, Ally,&quot; whispers the voice one last
time. &quot;I can try to stop them, but I have to know what you want.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then a door opens and she floats through it and out. Then
comes the clanking of a door that reminds her of the steel air lock she'd gone
through last night looking for Kristen. The smells. She's in the laboratory.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We can take her from here,&quot; comes a voice,
drifting through her reverie.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She fantasizes it's Karl Van de Vliet. Or maybe he really is
there. In her dream state it's hard to know. But he isn't alone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You said you'd make one more attempt to create the

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I said I would do all I could, W.B. The first attempt .

injection of all I managed to garner. Today I spent the day doing simulations.
We're working closer to the edge than I thought. That's why I needed her down
at the lab tonight. I want to run some more tests and then try to make a
decision. Tonight. There's just a hell of a lot more risk than I first
thought.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The voice trails off and Ally finds herself trying to
comprehend &quot;risk.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ally,&quot; comes a ghostly voice. Surely this is a
dream, and she recognizes it as her father, Arthur. Now she can see him. He's
wearing a white cap and they're boating in Central Park. He shows up in her
dreams a lot and she feels he's the messenger of her unconscious, telling her
truths that she sometimes doesn't want to hear.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ally,&quot; he says, &quot;he's going to perform the
full Beta procedure on you. He didn't tell you, but you know it's true. He thinks
he's finally calculated everything right. Can't you see? Is that what you
want?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She isn't sure what she wants. And right now she isn't
entirely clear where she fits on the scale of sleeping/waking. It is so
bizarre. The two parts of her mind, the conscious and the unconscious, are
talking to each other. Her unconscious is warning her about fears she didn't
even know she had. Or at least she hadn't admitted to yet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then she hears Winston Bartlett's voice again.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Karl, we can't save Kristen now. I've finally realized
that. She's gone too far. It's just a tragedy we'll have to figure out how to
live with.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The body is a complex chemical laboratory that
sometimes gets out of balance. There's always hope. I think—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Know what I fucking think?&quot; Bartlett cuts him off.
&quot;I think I'm in line for the Syndrome if you don't get this right.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What Ally wants to do, more than anything else, is to make
sense of what her options are. The most obvious one— in fact, maybe the only
one—is to flow along with that infinite river she feels around her, just to lie
where she is, in this sedative&#8209;induced reverie, and let her body be taken
over by Karl Van de Vliet. Perhaps he has marvelous things in store for her.
Except she has no idea what's real and what is imaginary.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The simulations are giving me some idea of what went
wrong with the Beta before.&quot; The voice is Van de Vliet's. &quot;I have one
more test to run, but if I handled this the way the simulation now suggests, I
think I could actually generate the telomerase antibodies we need and get the
Beta to finally work, avoiding the Syndrome. But to prove it would require a
full&#8209;scale experiment. I'm reluctant to do that without Alexa's
permission.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Christ, Karl, are you getting cold feet? This is a hell
of a time for that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Call it a pang of rationality.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But everything is at stake.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't know what's eventually going to happen with the
Syndrome, but it's criminal to jeopardize any more lives.&quot; Van de Vliet
sighs. &quot;Look, you had the procedure of your own free will, and you knew
the risks. Alexa Hampton didn't volunteer for the Beta. She's not a lab rat. At
the very least, we ought to get her to sign a release. The liability is. . . In
any case, I'm not doing anything till I run this last test. Then maybe I'll
have some idea exactly how much risk is involved.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And then, by God we're going to do it. Tonight. This is
it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She feels a cold metal object insinuate itself against her
chest. Time rushes around her, sending her forward on a journey that seems
increasingly inevitable. Where it's taking her, she has no idea, but she senses
she no longer has an option of whether she wants to go or not.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now her dreamscape has become crowded as Grant drifts in once
more. He seems to be wearing a white lab coat like the others. He settles beside
her and takes her hand</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ally, it's going to be okay. I'm going to be here for
you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Grant, why are you here? Do you really give a damn about me?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She wants to talk to him, but the words aren't working. Why
is this happening?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Don't let them give you more medications, she tells herself.
Get your mind back and get out of here.</span></p>

<h4><a name=bookmark35>Chapter 33</a></h4>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Friday,
April 10 </span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>8:45<span
style='text-transform:uppercase'> p.m.</span></span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ellen O'Hara had not left after the day shift ended at six <span
style='text-transform:uppercase'>p.m</span>. Instead, she had told Dr. Van de
Vliet that she wanted to reorganize some of the NIH paper files she kept in her
office on the first floor. The truth was, she had become convinced that the
culmination of something deeply evil was scheduled for later that night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The evil had begun when Kristen Starr's mother arrived
looking for her and declaring that she'd been kidnapped. Then after Dr. Vee
categorically denied he knew anything about her (a blatant lie), Kristen was
brought back to the institute from wherever she'd been moved to, and she was
visibly changed. She was whisked down to the subbasement the moment she arrived
and immediately sealed off in intensive care, but it was clear she had no idea
who she was or where she was. Something horrible had happened to her. And maybe
it was imagination, but she no longer even looked like a grown woman.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then this morning, Bartlett and his Japanese bodyguard
brought in the young man who had accompanied Alexa</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Hampton, but
he wasn't put through the admissions formalities. Instead he was taken directly
downstairs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>May at the front desk said she thought he was a newspaper
reporter she’d met once when they were on a public&#8209;health panel together.
That was when Ellen realized he was Stone Aimes, that feisty medical columnist
for the New York Sentinel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now Stone Aimes might be able to save Alexa Hampton.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Dr. Van de Vliet and Debra had carried out a special stem&#8209;
cell procedure for her aortic stenosis, the first that they had attempted for
that particular condition. The results, as shown by her file, were nothing
short of astonishing. She’d begun responding in a matter of hours.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She should be in a room upstairs, so why was she still down
in the subbasement?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now Ellen O'Hara knew the reason.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She had seen in the file that they were going to perform the
Beta procedure on Alexa Hampton. When they'd performed it on Kristen Starr, the
result was a horrific side effect. And now they were going to do it again.
Tonight.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The criminality that started with Kristen Starr and Katherine
Starr was going to be compounded. She was about to become part of a criminal
conspiracy. She had to put a stop to it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was nervous about confronting Van de Vliet, but she
didn't know what she could say that wouldn't sound like an indictment. Still,
she was damned well determined to do it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>If nothing else, it would provide a diversion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She put away the files and walked out into the dim hallway,
then made her way into the reception area.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Everything all right, Grace?&quot; she asked the nurse
at the desk.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My, you're working late,&quot; came the pleasant reply.
&quot;Quiet as a mouse around here. I guess it'll be even quieter when the
clinical trials are finished. I mean, after the celebrating is over.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Right.&quot; But they're not over, Ellen thought. And
there may</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>not  </span></i><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>be a celebration. &quot;I'm going
down to sublevel one. Is Dr. Vee down there now?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think he's in his office. Everybody else went out for
a bite, probably that diner down the road. I think something's scheduled for
later on. I don't know. Everybody looks kind of worried.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, nobody has said anything to me.&quot; They don't
need to, she thought. I saw the file.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She swiped her card through the security slot and got onto
the elevator.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When she stepped off, the laboratory was dark and a light was
showing under Dr. Van de Vliet's office door.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Good. She swiped her card in the reader next to the
laboratory air lock and went in. Another swipe and she was on the elevator down
to the subbasement, where she was not authorized to be.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She went to the second door and slipped her card through the
slot, wondering what she would see.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The room was dark and smelled of alcohol and disinfectant.
She quickly closed the door behind her before turning on the overhead
fluorescents.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Alexa Hampton was secured to the bed with restraints, and she
appeared to be sedated, though she did slowly open her eyes as the light
flickered and then stabilized. There was a wheelchair in the corner.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ms. Hampton, can you hear me?&quot; she whispered,
hoping not to alarm her. &quot;Do you remember me? I was the one who helped you
when you were first admitted.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She watched as Alexa stared at her for a moment and then
quietly nodded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I . . . I want to get out of here.&quot; Her eyelids
fluttered and then she closed her eyes again. &quot;But I'm too weak. I can't
move.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're strapped down, love. Let me help you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She reached for the Velcro straps and then paused. Was this a
decision she wanted to make?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>If I do this, it's the end of my career here. Have I lost my
mind? What will I do after this?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But if I don't try to stop them, God knows what . . . we
could all end up convicted of criminal conspiracy and in prison.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That reporter friend of yours is here.&quot; She pulled
open the straps, then helped Alexa sit up in the bed and swing her legs around.
&quot;I'm going to take you to him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's so horrible,&quot; Ally went on. She was settling
into the wheelchair as though she expected it. Then she looked up, her eyes
dazed. &quot;Where are you taking me? 'Reporter'? Do you mean—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Like I said I'm moving you into your friend's
room.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She rolled her to the door, then stopped and cracked it and
peeked out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't say a word dear,&quot; she whispered as she began
pushing Alexa down the hall. There was a pale flickering light under the door
at the end. &quot;Debra and </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>David</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> and the others have all gone out to
the diner down the road and Dr. Vee is in his office, probably running some
last&#8209;minute computer simulations. But we need to be quiet.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The fluorescent lights seemed to swirl overhead. This all
feels so familiar, Ally thought. This is where I saw Kristen. Does Ellen know
what happened to her?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You two have to decide what you want to do.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Stone? You're sure he's here?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Yes,&quot; she said &quot;and he's in some kind of
battle of wills with Mr. Bartlett.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When they reached the door at the end she tried it and it was
locked. She pulled out her magnetic card and zipped it through the slot.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As they went through, Ally realized the room was lit only by
the glow of a laptop computer screen.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Stay here,&quot; Ellen said turning to leave. &quot;I'm
going to try to talk to Dr. Vee.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As the door closed Stone finally looked up. He was wearing a
sweater and jeans and had been typing furiously on a Gerex laptop.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey, how're you feeling?&quot; He paused to glance down
and save what he'd been writing, then clicked off the computer.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I have no idea.&quot; Something about him didn't seem
quite right. It was like he was on happy pills or something. &quot;How about
you? The last time I saw you, I was passing out.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't actually remember all that much of what
happened after that. I think I went back to the city. But I feel great now.
Like I went through a dark tunnel and came out the other side. I feel very
different. I don't know what's next, but right now I'm just happy to be in the
middle of the biggest story in the history of medical science.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What's going on with him? she wondered. He's spacey. He has
to be on some kind of drug. What have they done to him?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He closed the laptop, then reached and clicked on a light by
the bed. &quot;Come on. Want to see something incredible? It's a marvel of
medical science, never before happened.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Come with me. I guarantee you've never seen anything
like it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He tossed the laptop onto the bed, then swung his feet around
and settled them onto the floor. She noticed that the room was a pale blue,
with white linoleum. There was a pair of white slippers next to the bed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He slipped them on and then opened the door and grabbed her
wheelchair.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The hallway felt colder now, yet it was also stifling, as
though someone had drawn the air out of it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There's nothing we can do,&quot; Stone said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There was a hint of madness in his voice. It was as if he
were trying to convince himself that he was still sane, and it wasn't working.
He was just barely holding it together.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then she realized he was about to go into intensive care,
where Kristen had been.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So Kristen's still here?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Oh, you'd better believe it,&quot; he said. &quot;She
is most definitely still here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When they got to the door, he revolved back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ally, you really don't have to see this, you know. Not
if you'd rather . . . Nothing remotely like this is going to happen to you.
They assured me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What the hell is he talking about?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;On the other hand,&quot; he went on, &quot;maybe you
should see it. Maybe everybody in the world should see it. It's so
astonishing.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He pushed open the door and rolled her in. Then he reached
down and lifted her to her feet. Standing wasn't that hard, and somehow he had
known that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The room seemed to be captured in mist, though surely that
was her imagination. Everything must be her imagination.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Kristen was in the corner of the room, in a wheelchair, but
now her body was shriveled. No, shriveled was not the right word. In fact,
there might not be a word to describe the change. Her skin was smooth and
flawless. She didn't look like this the last time Ally saw her and now she
wondered how long ago that actually was. How many hours, or days?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The bones were the same as always; in her cheeks the
underlying structure was sharp and severe and elegant. But there wasn't enough
flesh on them. They were reminiscent of what happens at puberty, when the body
starts changing in ways that aren't well coordinated.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was it. Kristen had become a child—it was in her
innocent eyes—except that her body was now the flesh of a child over the bone
structure of an adult.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It scarcely seemed like the same person from the last time.
She had crossed some mystical divide. She was holding a large rag doll—where
did she get that? Ally wondered—and humming the tune of the ditty that ended
with &quot;<i>Now I know my ABC's. Tell me what you think of me</i>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;She can't talk,&quot; Stone was saying.
&quot;I mean, actually communicate. Or at least she doesn't seem to want to.
I've already tried. But isn't what's happened incredible? There's never been
anything like this in history. The replacement cells are making her body newer
and newer, so she's getting younger and younger.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally walked over, slowly, and tried to take her hand. She was
grasping the doll and she violently pulled back.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hey,&quot; she said, trying to muster a matter&#8209;of&#8209;fact
air, &quot;how's it going? Do you remember me?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't think she recognizes you,&quot; Stone said in a
stage whisper. &quot;I wish I knew more about the biology of the brain, but I
think there's some kind of aggressive replacement of memory synapses under way.
I think it's one of those LIFO things. Last in/first out. She's regressing
chronologically, but in reverse. Maybe she's lost use of language, the way
Alzheimer's patients do. I don't know.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally felt herself near to tears. &quot;Van de Vliet was going
to use antibodies from me to try to . . . something.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That was always a long shot,&quot; he said. &quot;But
now the preliminary tests he's just done on you indicate that the level of
enzyme in you can be controlled very accurately. He's very excited.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She turned back to him. &quot;How do you know all this?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've become part of the story, Ally. That's not
supposed to happen, but this is the only way to get it all firsthand. I have to
live it. And guess what, I now know enough to write the book I've been waiting
all my life to write. I have the punch line.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Which is?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Stem cell technology goes to the very origin of life,
and it may turn out that for once Mother Nature can be fooled. Dr. Vee's
venturing into areas now where even he doesn't know what's going on. Ally,
what's happening in this room is the biggest medical story since . . . Nothing
begins to compare.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Stone had lost it. There was true madness about him now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She walked back over to Kristen and leaned over and</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>kissed her.
Kristen stared at her in unfocused confusion, but then she smiled.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm alone in here. Will you take me outside? I want to
find my mother.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The voice was that of a five&#8209;year&#8209;old and it sent
a chill through Alexa. The &quot;grown&#8209;up&quot; memory cells in her brain
had been replaced by blanks. It was &quot;last in/first out&quot; and thirty&#8209;plus
years of life experience were being replaced with brand&#8209;new nothingness.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The Syndrome. Time had to move in one direction or the other.
The body either went forward or in reverse. There was no equilibrium.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then she had a further thought. Winston Bartlett was not
going to let this Beta disaster run to its natural conclusion— a horrifying
exposure to the world. He was going to intervene. Kristen was not about to
leave this room in her current condition. Either she left cured—which seemed
wholly implausible at this point—or she departed in a manner that left no
trace.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then yet another thought crossed her befuddled mind. She and
Stone knew about Kristen. What does that mean for us?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Stone, we can't leave her here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What are you proposing we do?&quot; he queried.
&quot;Take her to an ER somewhere? Frankly, I don't know how you would describe
her problem to an emergency room admissions staffer.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll think of something.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;By the way, Ally, so you should know, she's wearing
diapers. This is the real deal.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And how do you figure in all this?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I told you. I'm going to be the James Boswell of stem
cell technology. I'm going to report on this miracle from the inside. But now,
Ally, if the Beta procedure is going to succeed you have to be the one to make
it happen.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She looked at him, still stunned by the wildness in his eyes.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>And she had
a feeling like her heart was being wrenched out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're working with them, aren't you?&quot; She was
fuming with anger. She no longer knew who could be trusted. He'd taken leave of
his senses. Or had his senses been taken from him? Which was it?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm thinking about you. And hopefully about us. You're
being offered something you'd be a fool to turn down. That's all I have to
say.&quot; He took her hand and helped her back into the wheelchair. Then he
whispered, &quot;Let's get out of here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He quickly opened the door and rolled her out into the empty
hall. When he closed the door behind them, he whispered again. &quot;Didn't you
see the surveillance camera and microphone in there? There's one in the room
where they had me locked up. They just put them in.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;To watch Kristen?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And me. I heard Bartlett and Van de Vliet talking. If
any of this Beta screw&#8209;up with her gets out of this building, Bartlett's
conglomerate is toast.&quot; He bent over near to her and continued whispering.
&quot;Listen, we don't have much time. They've got your procedure scheduled for
later on tonight. I'm still somewhat of a zombie from something they gave me,
but maybe I can help get you out of here. Let me tell you what I've found out
so far. Van de Vliet gave you a low&#8209;dosage version of the Beta procedure,
in hopes he could harvest telomerase antibodies and use them on Bartlett. But
there was only a trace. He did inject those into Bartlett, but he doesn't think
it's enough to have any effect. So now Bartlett is demanding he give you a
massive dose of telomerase. Van de Vliet is freaked about the risks, but
Bartlett thinks it's his only chance to head off having what happened to
Kristen happen to him too. However, what Bartlett doesn't know is that Van de
Vliet has just finished a new computer simulation and he thinks he's finally
figured out how to do a successful Beta procedure. For him, that's the Holy
Grail.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How do you know all this?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I heard him talking to his assistant Debra. I was
supposed to be sedated. The reason he wants to perform it on you is because he
now has so much data on you, as a result of the first procedure. He thinks he's
got a real shot at redemption. Ally, if he's calculated wrong, you could end up
like Kristen.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What about you?&quot; she asked. &quot;You should get
out too.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I should, but . . . Look, I've been trying to get in
here for a long time. Now I'm finally in. You could say I'm under duress, but
I'm here and this is where it's happening. If I get out alive, I have a hell of
a story.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Is he thinking clearly? she wondered. He seems to be drifting
in and out of a mental cloud. What is wrong with him?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Stone, there's an emergency door on the first level of
the basement. If we can get up there, we might be able to escape. And while
we're doing it, you might want to seriously reconsider staying in this place.
We've both seen Kristen. What makes you think they're planning on either of us
ever living to tell that tale?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm having some trouble thinking just now.&quot; He was
helping her out of the wheelchair. &quot;But I do know you've got to disappear.
Whatever plans they have for me remain to be seen, but I know exactly what's in
store for you. So come on and try to walk. We can't use the elevator, but
there's a fire door at the other end of the hall, which leads up to the lab
floor.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It's probably alarmed, she thought. Then what do we do?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Walking was easier than she'd expected. The strength was
rapidly coming back in her legs. But more than that, there was no sense of
tightness in her chest as she might have expected. She was always aware of
traces of stenosis, but now she felt nothing. Maybe there were miracles.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The hallway was dimly lit, and she wondered, Is a
surveillance camera tracking our every move?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Shit,&quot; Stone announced when they reached the fire
door, &quot;it's alarmed.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That's exactly what I was afraid of, she thought.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Any chance they're bluffing?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't think so.&quot; He pointed. &quot;That little red
diode says it's hot.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>God, she thought we've got to get out of here. &quot;Maybe we
could just make a dash for it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He looked at her and shook his head. &quot;Like you're in
shape to dash? No, what's called for is stealth.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was pulling out his wallet. &quot;The thing about these
card readers, some of them, like those that get you into bank ATMs, sometimes
will open for other cards. I've got four kinds of plastic. Might as well give
them a try.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, just hurry.&quot; She leaned against the wall.
&quot;I'm starting to get weak.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He slipped his Visa through and nothing happened. He
immediately tried MasterCard. Again nothing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe I should try my all&#8209;purpose bankcard.&quot;
He slipped a Chase plastic through, but once more nothing happened.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This isn't working, Stone.&quot; She sighed, feeling
her legs weaken as she clasped the wall. &quot;I think we're going to have to
chance the elevator.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't give up yet.&quot; He took out his American
Express, kissed it and swiped it through. &quot;One last shot.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2>The red diode blinked off.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Never leave home without it,&quot; she whispered.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We will now proceed very, very quietly.&quot; He
carefully pushed open the door, inches at a time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The stair had metal steps and was lit by a single fluorescent
bulb. As he helped her up, Ally was wondering if there was any way to extract
her mother too. She couldn't imagine how she could do it and besides, Nina
might well refuse to go.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No, just get out and make Stone understand that no way was
Winston Bartlett going to let him go free to tell the story of Kristen. He
clearly wasn't thinking with all cylinders.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Stone Aimes was about to disappear, just like Kristen had.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The entry to the laboratory level was also alarmed, but
American Express once again saved the day. When they pushed open the door,
however, the lights were on in the office at the far end of the hallway.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Where's that door that Grant was going to use to get me out?
she wondered. Then she saw a door marked<span style='text-transform:uppercase'>
exit</span> next to Van de Vliet's office.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Shit, it's all the way at the opposite end of the hall.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Stone, we have to get to that door before anybody sees
us. I don't know if it's alarmed or not, but that's the ball game.&quot; She
reached for his hand. &quot;If we can get there and get out, please come with
me. We can make it to the highway. You can't stay here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Let's get you out. Then we'll talk.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'll drag you if I have to.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As they moved quietly along the wall, they could hear an
argument under way. She recognized the voices as Ellen 'Hara's and Karl Van de
Vliet's.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I won't allow my staff to be part of this,&quot; Ellen
was declaring. &quot;I've seen Kristen. Any form of the Beta is dangerous. If
you do anything involving that procedure again, you'll put everybody here at
risk.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't you think I've thought about that, agonized about
it? We have one chance to turn all this around. This is it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't want to be involved and I don't want any of my
people involved do you hear me?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then keep them upstairs.&quot; He was striding out of
his office, flipping on the lights in the hallway.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Oh shit,&quot; Ally whispered. She opened a door and
pulled Stone into the examining room, where her mother had first been admitted.
Just as she did she heard the ding of the elevator and caught a glimpse of
Debra and </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>David</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> Van de Vliet's senior researchers,
getting off.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When she closed the door, the room should have been pitch
black. But it wasn't. A candle was burning on a counter and there was a figure
at the far end of the room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was sitting on the examining table, in the lotus position,
his eyes closed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Are you ready?&quot; Kenji Noda asked. &quot;I think
just about everyone is here now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Oh my God, Ally thought. What are we going to do?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She watched helplessly as he reached over and touched a
button on the desk. A red light popped on above the door. A moment later, it
opened.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What are you doing here?&quot; Debra asked, staring at
them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Getting some exercise,&quot; Stone said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then Winston Bartlett appeared in the doorway behind her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;How did they get up here?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ally, I'm not going to let them do this to you,&quot;
Stone declared, seizing her hand. &quot;We're going to—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ken, please get him out of here,&quot; Bartlett said.
'Take him back downstairs, anywhere.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You shouldn't be out of your wheelchair,&quot; Debra
was saying. She turned to Ellen. &quot;Would you get—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm not getting you anything,&quot; Ellen O'Hara
declared. &quot;I've just submitted my resignation. Effective three minutes
ago. I don't know a thing about what's going on here and, from now on, I don't
want to know.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She got on the elevator and the door closed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ken,&quot; Bartlett said, &quot;first things first. Go
after that woman. Don't let her leave the building.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now Debra was rolling in a wheelchair. </span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>David</span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:windowtext'> had appeared also, deep disquiet in his eyes, and he
helped her in.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;There's very little risk to this,&quot; he said.
&quot;Believe me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2>She felt him giving her an injection in her left
arm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No, don't . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As the room started to spin, she reached out and grabbed
Stone’s arm and pulled him down to her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Downstairs,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Look around.
There's—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She didn't get to finish because Debra was whisking her out the
door and toward the laboratory. Stone had just grinned confusedly, seemingly
not paying any attention to what she was saying. Instead he ambled toward the
open stair door and disappeared.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At this point, however, no one appeared to notice or to care.
They were rolling her through the steel air lock. On the other side, Winston
Bartlett was already waiting, standing next to a gurney with straps.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>9:34<span
style='text-transform:uppercase'> p.m.</span></span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was still conscious as </span><span style='font-size:
 10.0pt;color:windowtext'>David</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
and Debra lifted her onto the gurney. There was no operating table in the
laboratory, but this procedure did not require one. It consisted of a series of
small subcutaneous injections along both sides of the spine, followed by a
larger injection at the base of the skull.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As the injections began, she drifted into a mind&#8209;set
where she was never entirely sure how much was real, how much was fantasy, how
much deliberate, how much accidental. She remembered that she felt her grasp of
reality slipping away, but there was no sense of pain. Instead, images and
sensations in a sequence that corresponded to the passage of time drifted
through her mind. It was couched in terms of the people she knew.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The first image was her mother, Nina, and they were together,
struggling through a dense forest Initially, she thought they were looking for
her father's grave, but then it became clear they were searching for some kind
of magic potion that would save her mother’s life. As they clawed their way
through tangled tendrils and dark arbors, she became increasingly convinced
their quest was doomed, that she was destined to watch Nina pass into oblivion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But then something happened. The forest opened out onto a
vast meadow bathed in sunshine. In the center was a cluster of snow&#8209;white
mushrooms, and she knew instinctively that these would bring eternal life to
anyone who ate them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Come,&quot; she said to Nina, &quot;these can save
you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ally, I'm too old now. I don't want to be saved. There
comes a moment in your life when you've done everything you feel you needed to
do. You've had the good times and now all that's left is the slow deterioration
of what's left of your body. It robs the joy out of living.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, Mom, this is different,&quot; she said plucking one
of the white mushrooms and holding it out. &quot;This prevents you from growing
any older. You'll stay just the way you are. You can have a miracle.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>       “'To
never escape this vale of tears? To watch everyone you love grow old and wither
and die? Is that the 'miracle' you want me to have?&quot; Then she looked up at
the flawless blue sky and held out her arms as though to embrace the sun.
&quot;My mind Ally. You've given me back my mind. Now I can live out whatever
more life God will see fit to give me and actually know who I am and where I
am. That's miracle enough for me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As she said it, a beam of white light came directly from the
sun and enveloped her. Then the meadow around them faded away and all she could
see was Karl Van de Vliet, who was bending over her and lifting back her
eyelids.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Alexa, I can't tell you what you're about to feel,
because no one has ever been where you're about to be. God help us, but we're
on the high wire without a net here. But any new cell configurations should
immediately form tissue that's a facsimile of what's already there. That's what
the simulations show.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was listening to him, not sure if he was real or a dream.
Then she heard Bartlett's voice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Why are you talking to her, Karl? She can't hear
you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We don't actually know whether she can or not. At some
level I think she's aware of her surroundings. In a way we should hope that she
is. If there are going to be impacts on her consciousness, I'd rather she be
alert and able to remember what it was like.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then the voices drifted away, but she was sure she had no
control over anything. The white mushrooms. She was thinking about them again.
Only now they were above her and growing toward the sky and then she realized
she was underground, buried and looking up from her own grave.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What happened next was a journey through time—somewhere in
the far&#8209;distant future. She seemed to be watching it through a large
window, unable to interact with what was happening on the other side.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She felt a sensation at the back of her neck and the images
faded away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This damned well better be right&quot; came a voice.
&quot;There's not going to be another chance.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I did an activity simulation for a range of antibodies,
just to make sure she wouldn't automatically reject the enzyme because of the
earlier injection.&quot; The voice belonged to Karl Van de Vliet Her mind was
clearing and she recognized it &quot;But all the results indicate that the
effect of the antibodies is essentially washed out at this concentration of
active enzyme. Have the good grace to let me try to get this right.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was listening and trying to understand what was going on.
Her mind had been drifting through time and space, but now she was aware that
something new was happening. The hallucinations, the conversations around her,
all were beginning to focus in, to build in intensity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But that was not what was really happening; it was merely a
mask over something that had entered the laboratory, some kind of force.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then her vision began to work in a strange way that felt more
like a sixth sense. She was &quot;seeing&quot; what was going on in the room,
even though her eyes were shut. Or perhaps they weren't. She didn't know and
she was still strapped to the gurney, so she had no way to check.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>       
&quot;Kristy,&quot; Winston Bartlett said dismay in his voice, &quot;you
shouldn't be in here. You should be resting.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What the hell are you doing down here?&quot; Van de
Vliet demanded. The pitch of his voice had noticeably gone up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Who? Ally wondered. Who's he talking to?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There are definitely new people in the room.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Come on, Ally,&quot; said a voice in her ear, urgent.
This time she knew who it was. It was Stone. &quot;Damn them all. I'm getting
you out of here. Now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She felt the straps on the gurney loosening and then she
started prying her eyes open. She thought, hoped, it was Stone, but she
couldn't see well enough to be absolutely sure. Her mind and her vision were
still overflowing with horrifying nightmares of time gone awry. What did all
those bizarre dreams mean?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was groggy but was coming alert. Perhaps it was the sense
of electricity in the room, but something very unscheduled was going on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>When she finally got her eyes open and focused, what greeted
her was a blinding row of white lights directly overhead that seemed to isolate
her. But there was tumult all around her in the lab, a cacophony of alarmed
voices echoing off the hard surfaces of glass and steel. She squinted into the
light as she felt Stone slip his arm around her shoulders and raise her up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Thank God, he's here, she thought.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Come on,&quot; he was saying. &quot;She's not
interested in you. She just wants Kristen out of here. This is the only
way.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who . . . ?&quot; She was startled by the sound of her
own voice, mildly surprised to discover she was even capable of speech.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She gazed around, trying to find her when . . . Jesus!</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Katherine Starr was standing next to Kristen. She was moving
in a surreal way, gripping Kristen's hand and pulling her along.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Stone had found her. He had understood. Katherine Starr
appeared to be wearing a blue bathrobe under a gray mackintosh, but the part
that got Ally's attention was the knife she was holding, glistening like a
scalpel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>No, it <i>was </i>a scalpel, shiny and sharp as a razor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Tough luck, guys. No pistol this time, but she still managed
to come up with a convincing substitute.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She didn't look any saner than she did the last time. Now,
though, she finally had what she'd come for. She had her daughter. Could it be
that Kristen was about to be liberated? Had the world come full circle?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No.&quot; The voice belonged to Winston Bartlett.
&quot;I want her with me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You 're the prick responsible for this.&quot; Katherine
whirled on him, brandishing the scalpel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mrs. Starr,&quot; Van de Vliet interjected, eyeing the
sharp metal, &quot;you can't take Kristen away now. She's at a very delicate
stage of her procedure.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I seem to be doing a lot of things I can't,&quot; she
declared turning back. &quot;I'm not supposed to be out of my room, but I am.
And now I'm getting us both out of here. We're going through that air lock and
onto the elevator. So whose throat do I need to cut to do it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Winston Bartlett was edging away, and his eyes betrayed he
was more concerned than he wished to appear.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Look at her,&quot; Katherine Starr continued
shoving Kristen— who was completely disoriented her eyes blinking in
confusion—in front of Van de Vliet. &quot;She doesn't know me; she doesn't know
anything. She's acting like a baby. What in hell have you done to her?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She had the procedure she wanted. At the time I warned
there might be side effects we couldn't anticipate.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;She's lost her mind. That's what you call a <i>side
effect</i>?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>All this time Kristen was just standing and staring blankly
into space, but there were growing storm clouds welling in her eyes. It caused
Ally to wonder what was really going on with her. Had this troubled girl been
made permanently childlike, or was there a split personality at work? Did she
have a new mind now, or a parallel mind?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We're still trying to stabilize her condition,&quot;
Van de Vliet said in a soothing tone. &quot;We just need a little more
time.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was when Kristen wrenched free of her mother's grasp.
Her eyes had just gone critical, traveling into pure madness. She strode over
and seized a glass jar containing a clear solvent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I want them all to die,&quot; she said in a little
girl's voice. &quot;They're going to kill me if I don't kill them first.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now Katherine Starr had turned and was staring at her.
&quot;Kristy, honey, put the bottle down. I'm going to take you home. I don't
know what he's done to you, but I'm not going to let you stay here anymore.
You're coming with me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>This is not going to end well, Ally thought. She began
struggling to her feet, trying to clear her mind enough for an exit strategy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Nina was upstairs, or at least that was where she had been.
Okay, the first order of business is to get her out. Stone could probably manage
on his own . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now Kristen was walking over to an electric heater positioned
on a lab workbench. She switched it on and the tungsten elements immediately
began to glow. Then, still holding the bottle, she turned back to Van de Vliet.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I see things that I never saw before. My mind has
powers it never had till now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He nodded knowingly. &quot;I always suspected that—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm able to think just like I did when I was
little,&quot; she continued, cutting him off. &quot;Sometimes I'm there, in
that</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>world. Then
sometimes I flip back. But I can always tell when grown&#8209;ups are lying to
me. What did you do to my mind?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Kristen,&quot; Van de Vliet said &quot;the brain has
many functions that we still only barely understand. With the Beta procedure,
we don't really know what activates general cell replacement or what the nature
of the replacement tissue actually is. We're just at the beginning of a
marvelous—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm seeing a future in which nothing exists,&quot; she
muttered despairingly, still holding the glass bottle of solvent. &quot;I don't
want to be a part of it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Van de Vliet was staring at her, his eyes flooded with alarm.
&quot;What . . . what are you seeing, Kristen?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm seeing you dead.&quot; She glared around &quot;All
of you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then, with an animal scream, she whirled and flung the glass
liter bottle at the electric heater on the laboratory workbench. It crashed
into the shiny steel case with a splintering sound followed by an explosion
that sent a ball of fire and a shock wave through the room. In an instant the
entire end of the lab was engulfed in a sea of flame.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally sensed herself being knocked to the floor, but she also
felt a surge of adrenaline. This was endgame, the moment when everybody found
out who they were.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A hand was gripping her like a vise. It was Stone's, but the
blast had knocked him to the floor too and he was now motionless, slumped
against the side of a laboratory bench. It was like she was being held in a
death grip. Was she going to have to carry him out? She wasn't even sure she
had the strength in her legs to get herself out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now something even more horrible was slowly beginning to
happen. The central part of the lab had several sets of steel shelving arranged
in rows, and each supported a carefully organized arrangement of sample vials
filled with some kind of organic solvent. She saw with horror that the first
towering set of shelves, easily seven feet high, was slowly tipping from the
force of the blast. It teetered for an instant and then fell into the set of
shelves next to it with all the ponderous majesty of a giant sequoia.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What happened next sounded like the end of the world. As the
first set of shelves crashed against the second, like a row of massive steel&#8209;and&#8209;glass
dominoes, each subsequent tower tipped and fell against the next, and on and
on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>All the while, as the tumbling racks were spewing flammable
solvents across the smoky lab space, they were ripping out electrical wiring
and sending sparks flying.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The whole danger&#8209;dynamic of the room had been turned
upside down. Katherine Starr and Debra and </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
 color:windowtext'>David</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
now lay pinned beneath a tangled mass of angle&#8209;iron supports that had
collapsed in the wake of the falling shelves. All three appeared to be
unconscious.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Winston Bartlett was at the far end of the room. He'd been
slammed against the wall by the force of the explosion but was pulling himself
up. He seemed to be unhurt, though it was hard to see through the billowing
smoke.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Karl Van de Vliet was standing in the middle of the
laboratory, his eyes glazed, flames and smoke swirling about him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What does this mean to him? Ally wondered. Years of research
data being obliterated in an instant.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But the horror wasn't over. The fire was depleting the
hermetically sealed room's oxygen. Ally sensed that anybody who didn't get out
of the lab in the next five minutes wasn't going to be going anywhere standing
up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But what was happening with Kristen? She was walking through
the flames as though on a country stroll. It was like the fires of hell were
all around her and she was ambling through them unscathed. She must be
experiencing third&#8209;degree burns, Ally thought, yet there’s a sense that
nothing can harm her. How could it be?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And then an astonishing possibility began to dawn on her.
With the stem cell enzymes working at full blast, was it possible her body was
immediately replacing its damaged cells? Could it be that the telomerase enzyme
didn't know the difference between a cell that had aged and one that had been
damaged by its environment?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Jesus,&quot; Stone said, finally stirring,
&quot;what's—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At that moment the overhead lights flickered and died and the
emergency lights clicked on, sending battery&#8209;powered beams through the
smoke.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Christ, Ally,&quot; he declared gazing around still
dazed as his consciousness seemed to be slowly returning. &quot;We've got to
get people out of here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There didn't appear to be a sprinkler system. Probably, she
thought, because an onslaught of water would wipe out all the computers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now she was thinking about the automatic air locks. How did
those steel&#8209;and&#8209;glass doors work without electricity? Did they have
a battery backup, or some kind of fail&#8209;safe mechanism, which provided a
manual override in case of a power outage?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now Winston Bartlett was striding toward the center of the
room. From the dazed look in his eyes, it wasn't clear whether he knew where he
was or not. Kristen was walking toward him, on a collision course.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You let this happen,&quot; she said &quot;You wanted to
ruin my life.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Kristy, nobody made you do anything,&quot; he said
choking from the smoke. &quot;But now we've got to—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's too late,&quot; she declared lashing out with the
side of her hand against his neck. He staggered back, flailing, and seized an
iron girder.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There was a blast of voltage, a shower of sparks, and he
screamed as he crumpled sideways. Then the force of his fall broke his hand
loose from the electrical short. He lay prostrate on the smoky floor of the
lab, twitching.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My God, Ally thought, she really is determined to kill us all
before she's through.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Kristen,&quot; Van de Vliet was saying, &quot;please.
There's still time. I'm going to do everything I can for you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was gasping for air and now more vials of flammable liquid
were exploding from the heat and igniting. He turned and stumbled toward the
air lock. There were sounds of yelling on the other side.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The people outside can't get through, Ally realized. The
security lock has no override.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>We 're going to die.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Van de Vliet pounded on the button controls of the air lock,
but there was no response. Smoke was billowing around him and he choked,
coughing and dropping to one knee.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then Kristen walked up behind him. She appeared not to notice
the flames and smoke swirling around her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This is where you get what's coming, you bastard. I
warned you you'd better do something for me. But you never really intended to
help me. I was just an experiment. That's all I ever was. For both of you. You
fuckers.&quot; And she lashed out with a powerful fist, sending him to the
floor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Outside there was now the wail of a siren, the sound faintly
filtering through. And the pounding on the other side of the air lock
continued, though now it had the force of authority.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>At last, Ally thought, somebody finally got serious and
called the fire department.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now Kristen had bent over the prostrate Van de Vliet and was
doing something, though Ally couldn't tell what.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Keep your face close to the floor,&quot; Stone was
yelling. &quot;It's where the last of the air is. Hang on. We'll be okay.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She had a premonition they were not going to be okay. They
all were going to suffocate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>All, that was, except Kristen. She seemed to possess some
magic immunity from the horrors around her. She had risen and was standing over
Van de Vliet like a statue, while everybody else was on the floor.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As Ally watched her—a serene figure in the middle of chaos
and death—she began to have an odd sensation. The burning in her lungs, from
the smoke, started to dissipate. And strength felt like it was pouring into her
limbs. The tongues of flame around her had become dancing white figures that
invited her to rise and join them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She did, slowly, not quite knowing what she was doing. Then
she walked to the jammed air lock. She stepped over Karl Van de Vliet's
collapsed frame and placed her hands on the steel. It was already scalding, but
she only took fleeting notice of that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>While a firefighter's ax futilely pounded on the outside, she
seized the wide bar of the door and ripped it open, to the sound of wrenching
metal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was a superhuman effort she didn't realize she was capable
of. And it was the last thing she remembered. The space around her had become a
blazing white cloud and she didn't feel the hands of the two firefighters who
seized her as she fell through the open air lock.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Days later, Alexa Hampton was still considering herself one
of the luckiest people alive. When she'd regained consciousness the next week
in Lenox Hill Hospital, hooked up to oxygen and being fed by an IV, she noticed
that the nurses were looking at her strangely and whispering to each other.
Finally she couldn't stand it anymore and asked why.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;It was what you did,&quot; a young Puerto
Rican woman declared, gazing at her in awe through her rimless glasses.
&quot;No one can believe it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then she explained. What they couldn't believe—as reported by
the New Jersey firefighters—was that she had single&#8209;handedly wrenched
open the steel&#8209;door air lock of the laboratory at the Dorian Institute.
At the time firefighters were on the other side vainly trying to dismantle the
door with their axes. Yet she'd just yanked it aside like paper. It was
reminiscent of those urban legends of superhuman strength in times of crisis,
like the story of a panicked woman who hoisted an overturned Chevy van to free
a pinned child. Later, though, some of the New Jersey fire crew went back and
looked again. The steel hinges had literally been sheared off. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>How did she do that? More important, though, symptoms of her
stenosis had entirely disappeared and she felt better than ever in her life.
The stem cell technology pioneered by Karl Van de Vliet had indeed produced a
miracle. She even had a new kind of energy, periodically. It was unlike
anything she’d ever felt.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Other things were new as well. She’d been seeing a lot of
Stone Aimes and helping him finish his book on the Gerex Corporation's
successful clinical trials with stem cell technology. After all the publicity
following the fire at the Dorian Institute, the manuscript was generating a lot
of buzz. A paperback auction was already in the works, with a half&#8209;million
floor, and Time had abruptly taken a second look at the &quot;first serial&quot;
excerpt his agent had been trying to place with them and come up with six
figures. The only part Stone hadn't reported was the ghastly side effect of the
early Beta experiment, the Syndrome, because Kristen Starr had disappeared. He
had no proof and his publisher refused to print potentially libelous
speculation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In the meantime, Winston Bartlett hadn't been seen in public
since that tragic day. The business press speculated he had become a Howard
Hughes&#8209;like recluse in his Gramercy Park mansion. Ally had tried several
times to reach him through his office to find out what he wanted to do about
the design job, and each time she was told he would get back to her. He never
did.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Maybe he was still recuperating. When the firefighters pulled
him out of the flaming wreckage, his clothes were singed from the electricity
that had coursed through his body, his heart was stopped and he appeared to be
dead. In fact, he was dead.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The paramedics immediately began intensive CPR. Moments
later, his heart was beating again. Then he declared he was well enough that he
didn't need to go to a hospital. He had his Japanese henchman, Kenji Noda, help
him to his McDonnell Douglas and he disappeared into the night.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Oxygen had not been to his brain for . . . No one knew how
long. The paramedics said he awoke in what seemed another reality.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Was he still alive? There had been no reports otherwise, but
he most certainly had withdrawn from the world.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Karl Van de Vliet, for his part, had been hospitalized for
severe burns. He remained in the trauma unit at St. Vincent's Hospital, but
when Alexa tried to go visit him, she was told he wasn't accepting visitors but
was doing well. Katherine Starr was dead from a massive concussion, along with
the two researchers, Debra Connolly and </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
 color:windowtext'>David</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>
Hopkins, who had been in the wrong place when the steel racks collapsed. And
Alexa never been able to find out what happened to Kristen Starr. Officially,
nobody by that name was there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But business was business. With the clinical trials over, the
pending sale of the Gerex Corporation to Cambridge Pharmaceuticals was
proceeding on autopilot, handled by Grant Hampton, who stood to make a bundle
or so he bragged to Alexa. The Dorian Institute had been closed and all the
remaining records moved to a converted facility near Liverpool.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After six days in Lenox Hill, Ally went home, and three days
after that she had returned to her desk at CitiSpace. Now, inevitably, she was
back to her workaholic habits and grueling hours.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Today, though, she had knocked off early, since Nina had
taken a cab down to join her for supper.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She marveled just thinking about it. Her mom taking a cab. By
herself. It truly was a miracle.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Their &quot;light&quot; repast had consisted of cold roast
beef and room&#8209;temperature stout, two of Nina's favorites. She had never
been much for cucumber sandwiches with the crust cut off. Afterward, she
elected to have a brandy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The trouble with having your mind back,&quot; she said
as she settled onto the couch, snifter in hand, &quot;is that sometimes you
remember things you'd just as soon forget.&quot; Outside thunder boomed from an
early evening rainstorm, which had blown in from the northwest.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, Mom, at least now you can pick and choose what
you want to remember and what you want to forget.&quot; She didn't really mind
the storm. Having her mother back was such a blessing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It still felt odd, though, having her rescued from what had
to be an inevitable, ignominious fate. It was as though time had gone in
reverse. A miracle was very much in progress. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was experiencing a miracle too, though of a slightly
different sort. She felt pretty much normal, if occasionally shaky and
uncertain on her feet. But at unexpected times she would have bursts of energy
that defied reality. They were, in fact, scary, like that thing with the steel
door. Something weird would sometimes take control of her body and she didn't
really know what it was. . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Truthfully, she was feeling some of that tonight. She had
joined her mother with a brandy and was thinking about taking Knickers for an
early walk, downpour or not. She wanted to see the river through the mists of a
storm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was when the phone rang. She got up and made her way to
the kitchen and took the receiver off the wall.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Hello.&quot; She was hoping it was Stone. He'd usually
call early in the evening to see what she was doing and ask if she wanted some
company.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Alexa, I need to see you,&quot; came a voice. The other
end of the line was noisy, as though a loud motor was running.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think you know who this is. If you would come down to
the river, right now, I will make it very much worth your while.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>For some reason, maybe it was telepathy, Knickers had begun
bouncing about the kitchen, angling for a walk, even though she normally was
mortally fearful of thunder.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now Ally did know who it was.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What was he doing calling her here at home, in a rainstorm?
After all these weeks.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Well, she thought, I have nothing left to fear from him or
any of them. Why not?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's raining,&quot; she said. &quot;This had better be
fast.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>And she hung up the phone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Who was that, honey?&quot; Nina asked. &quot;I hope it
wasn't anybody I know. You were somewhat abrupt.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Mom, they deserved whatever they got, and it's no big
deal. But I think I'm going to take Knickers out. She's making me nuts.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Ally couldn't focus on what had just happened. He had a lot
of nerve. On the other hand, she loved to be down by the river when it was this
way, shrouded in pastel mist.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Honey, it's raining cats and dogs,&quot; Nina declared.
&quot;You're apt to catch your death.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No, Mom, it's letting up now. I'll be all right,
really.&quot; She was digging out her tan raincoat and rubber galoshes from the
closet by the door. Knickers immediately realized what was up and began a dance
of joy, barking as she raced to find her leash.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Come on, honey,&quot; Ally said, taking the braided
leather. &quot;I want you close to me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The ride down in the elevator felt ominous, though Knickers
failed to share any of her apprehension as she bounced around the glass dome
and nuzzled Ally's legs. The thunder she was sometimes fearful of had lessened,
and that Ally thought had doubtless improved her courage.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The condominium no longer had a doorman. In hopes of trimming
costs, the condo board had sent out a secret ballot on the subject. By a narrow
margin the owners had voted to dispense with that particular frill. Although
she missed Alan and his early morning optimism about his Off&#8209;Broadway
hopes, she realized the economy was probably timely. All those weeks when she
hadn't been pulling her weight at CitiSpace, the nut on that operation hadn't
diminished any.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As she stepped onto Barrow Street, the late&#8209;spring air
was unseasonably brisk and the rain had blanked visibility down to almost
nothing. On other days this would had been that magical moment just after the
sun went down, when gorgeous fiery orange clouds hung over the Hudson, but now
there was a hint of brooding in the bleak rain. It fit the dark mood she felt
growing around her.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He wanted to meet her down by the river. Gripping Knickers'
leash, she checked the traffic lights, then marched across the West Side
Highway. The new esplanade along the river was awash in the rain and was
uncharacteristically empty.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was lucky for Knickers. Off&#8209;the&#8209;leash time.
Ally drew her close and clicked open the catch that attached it to her collar.
With a &quot;woof&quot; of joy, she dashed off toward the vacant pier, then
headed out.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Baby, slow down,&quot; Ally yelled but it was to no
avail. A second later, her fluffy sheepdog was lost in the rain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But she couldn't go far. The refurbished pier extended out
into the river for maybe the length of a football field and change. Beyond
that, there was at least half a mile of river before the shores of New Jersey
For all her enthusiasm, Knickers wasn't about to dive into the chilly Hudson
and swim for the horizon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>So where was he? He'd said &quot;down by the river.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>What to do now? She decided she might as well walk out after
Knickers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now she was noticing something odd. The air was chilly;
actually, raw was a better description. A last blast of unusual arctic air had
accompanied the rain. She could feel the temperature on her face. She had
stupidly gone out with just a light shirt under the raincoat, yet she didn't
feel the slightest bit cold. It was as though her metabolism had sped up, the
way it did during a run, though she wasn't breathing heavy or anything. It felt
like one of those strange moments she'd been having, when she felt superalive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Now Knickers was returning, but she was slinking back as
though fearful of something, the rain running off her face.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Come here, baby,&quot; Ally said, reaching out.
&quot;What is it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The darkness of the river flowed over her now, and for the
first time ever, she wished she'd brought along a flashlight . . .</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was when, out of the rain, she finally heard the sound.
It was an engine lowering from the sky, which Knickers must have already heard.
Then a helicopter, a McDonnell Douglas, materialized, lowering onto the empty
sports space on the pier.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The downdraft of the rotor threw spray against the FieldTurf
and into her eyes. But she gazed through it, unblinking, feeling an unexpected
sense of power entering her limbs. The rain should have felt cold, but she
didn't really notice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Maybe, she thought, they had to meet. They were bonded.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As the pilot cut the power, the engine began to wind
down—whoom, whoom, whoom—until it came to a dead stop and there followed an
unnatural silence. Finally the door on the side opened and a metal step dropped
down.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>After a moment's pause that seemed to last forever, he
appeared, at first a vague figure in the rain, but then he stepped down and
came toward her. He was wearing a white hat with a wide brim and a tan raincoat
that seemed more like a cloak than a coat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Alexa, I so appreciate your making time for me.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was hard to tell in the rain, but he appeared to be
strong, and there was actually a kind of radiance about him, as though he
carried his own special luminosity. He seemed completely transformed. The
question was, transformed how? He looked years younger than the last time she
saw him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I thought we should talk. I've been meaning to call
you. I wanted to see how you're doing.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That's not it at all, she told herself. What do you really
want?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Actually, I've been wanting to thank you,&quot; Winston</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Bartlett
went on. &quot;It turns out that you saved me after all. Your telomerase antibodies
finally kicked in. The initial ones Karl injected in me. It just took a few
weeks.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;And what about Kristen?&quot; she asked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>His look saddened.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You didn't hear?&quot; He shook his head. &quot;She . .
. died in the fire.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That doesn't sound right, Ally thought. She looked like she
was the only one who was going to survive it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Oh yeah? How did that happen?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You might as well know. She was burned beyond
recognition. The body still hasn't been officially identified. When the firemen
found her, she had a shard of glass through her throat. They thought she must
have fallen on something, but I fear it's entirely possible she could have done
it to herself.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Was that story true, or a bald&#8209;faced lie? Ally
wondered. Were they still hiding her someplace?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But why was he here? He certainly hadn't come to discuss the
kitchen design job for his Gramercy Park mansion. That was now long ago and far
away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Alexa,&quot; he said moving toward her, &quot;please
don't be frightened but there's something I have to find out.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He reached out with his left hand and seized her wrist. She
only saw the glint of the penknife in his right hand for an instant before he
slashed it across her palm.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What!&quot; she screamed and yanked her hand away.
Knickers gave a loud yelp and then howled mournfully.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Only then did she notice that there'd been just a momentary
flash of pain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's okay,&quot; Bartlett said reaching to soothe
Knickers. &quot;Just a superficial scratch. Now watch it. I want to know if
Karl had time to finish the procedure.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>My God. She didn't have to watch. She could already feel it
beginning to heal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What's . . . what's going on? Is this—?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:18.1pt'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;He had hopefully completed the Beta on you just before
Kristy's mother showed up. But did it work the way it was supposed to? We
didn't know. Until now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;My God. I knew I was feeling—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You received just the right amount of telomerase
injections,&quot; Bartlett interjected, &quot;to induce the Beta without any
side effects. It was the 'Goldilocks dosage' Karl had been trying to calculate,
just enough that only aged or damaged cells are replaced, while healthy tissue
is not altered.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She now realized that was why she'd been having bouts of
incredible energy.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;We're the only ones,&quot; he went on. &quot;Just us.
You and me. We've been given this gift, Alexa. And now we have the
responsibility that goes along with it.&quot; He glanced down at her hand.
&quot;By the way, how's that cut doing?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What are you getting at?&quot; It was definitely
healing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>A wave of thunder boomed over the river, sending Knickers
scurrying to Ally's side.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What I'm getting at is that you and I are now two very
special people. We both are living proof of what the Beta can achieve. The
question is, what are we going to do about it?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was still stunned.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;This is a lot to absorb. I'll have to think—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I've already thought about this and I believe it must
be kept secret at all cost. At least for now.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;But why? It's a miracle that—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;That must be handled prudently. I need your cooperation
with that.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was having extreme difficulty getting her mind around
what he was talking about.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't really know what's going on. I think I'd better
see some doctors. And Stone is finishing his book about . . . I've got to tell
him—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Those things cannot happen, Alexa.&quot; He looked out
at the river for a moment, then turned back. &quot;A brand&#8209;new world has
dawned. Finally all things are possible.&quot; He moved closer to her, then
reached out and took her wrist again. She looked down and realized the cut on
her hand was all but healed. &quot;For now, this has to be our secret, yours
and mine. Just us.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She thought about all that had happened in the weeks since
her wayward brother had accosted her running along this very river. It felt
like an eternity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm asking you not to talk about this,&quot; he
continued. &quot;To anyone. You must give me your solemn word.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She felt the grip on her wrist get stronger.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Now that we know the Beta can work,&quot; he went on,
his voice piercing through the rain, &quot;I am forming an elite association,
the Methuselah Society. Membership buys a guarantee that you can stop aging; in
fact, you can pick the age you want to remain. Karl is sure he can do that,
assuming the Beta worked with you. And now we see it has. The first memberships
will naturally be somewhat expensive, but as time goes by, the cost will be
gradually scaled down to respond to market forces. One may only join with a
companion, but for obvious reasons all those who undergo the Beta must be sworn
to secrecy, on pain of death, since there's bound to be a hue and cry and
government intervention if word leaks out that only individuals with significant
resources can have this miracle.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I think that's obscene,&quot; she said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I suspected you might feel that way. Which is why we're
having this talk. As I've explained the Methuselah Society will be contingent
on the utmost secrecy, at least initially. So the question is, are you on board
with this?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;The answer is, I'll do what I please.&quot; She was
thinking what a bombshell this would be to have in Stone's book. Stem cells—the
Fountain of Youth was no longer a dream.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Winston Bartlett had won his dice game with God. And now he
was planning to sweep the table. But he also was smart enough to realize he had
to cash in quickly and discreetly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Don't you realize how irresponsible that is?&quot; he
insisted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&quot;We
stand on the threshold of a new era for humankind. But if we let small&#8209;minded
politicians get involved with this, they might decide to forbid . . . Keep in
mind that using stem cell technology to regenerate organs is already
controversial. Just imagine what the self&#8209;appointed zealots would do with
this. The good of humanity is less important to them than their narrow&#8209;minded,
bigoted constituencies.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was when it finally dawned on her why he had lured her
down here by the river on a rainy night. What bette</span><span
 style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>r place</span><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'> for a convenient
&quot;accident&quot; if it came to that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She watched as he turned and raised a finger toward the open
door of the McDonnell Douglas.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The motor started and then another figure emerged and came
down the steps. She squinted through the rain and recognized Kenji Noda,
Bartlett's ever&#8209;present bodyguard. He was carrying a plastic bottle,
along with a small white towel.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He's going to chloroform me and then God knows what. I'm
about to disappear the same way Kristen did.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She stared at them both, wondering what to do.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Alexa, I regret to say that you are either with me or
you are a problem I cannot afford to have,&quot; Bartlett said, and then he
nodded to Noda.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Shit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She backed to the edge of the pier as Noda advanced on her
menacingly, dousing the cloth. He was a foot taller than she was and he weighed
over two hundred pounds.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Her first instinct was to run, but then she sensed an impulse
to stand her ground. Something told her to try to use her strength against him.
He wouldn't expect it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Out of the corner of her eye, she noticed that a white car
had pulled onto the pier and was cruising down the side, slowly inching their
way. It looked like a police vehicle, probably a couple of cops curious about
the presence of a helicopter on the Field Turf.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>They were approximately half a minute too late to make any difference.
Kenji Noda was five feet away and they were fifty yards away. And they probably
couldn't see what was going on anyway. The rain had chosen that moment to begin
to gush, shrouding everything in sheets of water.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Knickers was nudging at her leg, as though urging her to
flee. And again she thought about running, but an instinct told her to stand
her ground. She was feeling a sensation of power growing in her limbs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She found herself oddly calm as Kenji Noda reached her, then
wrapped his left arm around her neck and with his right hand clamped the cloth
over her nostrils. It was infused with chloroform—she knew the smell—but she
held her breath.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Then it happened. She casually reached up and took his left
arm and pulled it away from her neck.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was so easy. There was the same feeling of strength she'd
had when she wrenched open the air lock. Yet it was something that came and
went. She had no inkling how long it would last this time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I don't think you should do that,&quot; she said
continuing to pull his arm around behind him. Then she twisted it to the side
and there was a sickening snap as it came out of its shoulder socket</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He groaned lightly but did not speak. Instead he reached with
his right hand and pulled an automatic out of a holster at the back of his belt
dropping the chloroformed cloth in the process. While his left arm dangled
uselessly, he brought around the pistol and tried to aim it at her torso. Her
senses, though, were coming fully alive now and she seized his wrist and pushed
it away just as he fired.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The round caught her at the outer edge of her shoulder. She
felt it enter and exit, but there was no pain, merely a mild itch. Still
holding his wrist, she picked up the white cloth and buried his face in it. She
held it against his nostrils until his body twitched and went limp.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was when the spotlight hit them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Drop your weapons and show your hands,&quot; came a
basso voice over a megaphone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Who had a weapon? she wondered. The one pistol around was
lying on the ground next to the crumpled frame of Kenji Noda.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The police must have heard the shot and assumed they were
being fired on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She turned around to search for Winston Bartlett and saw him
retreating to the McDonnell Douglas. Running, actually.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He saw what happened, she told herself. He's afraid of me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Stop and identify yourself,&quot; came the police
megaphone. The spotlight was now squarely on Bartlett, who was bounding up the
retractable steps.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Without looking back, he pulled up the steps and slammed the
door. The rotor had already begun revving higher, and in moments the chopper
had begun its ascent out over the dark river.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You have been warned to identify yourself,&quot; came
the futile megaphone. The chopper had all but disappeared into the dark and
rain when she heard a shot fired from the direction of the police car.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It must have been an accident, she told herself. There's no
way—</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But the smooth hum of the engine dying away in the fog
abruptly changed tone, then started to sputter. Ten seconds later, there was
silence.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was so engaged she didn't notice the stirring at her
feet. A moment thereafter, she saw the towering bulk of Kenji Noda rise up
beside her. Then she felt his grip on her wrist and realized he was dragging,
and pulling her to the edge of the pier. Then she felt a shove and a swirl of
dark air around her, followed by the splash of cold water. Surprisingly, it
didn't really feel freezing—it just felt refreshingly brisk. With one hand she
grabbed one of the square concrete pillars that was supporting the pier. The
mysterious strength she'd had from time to time was coming back once more.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That was when she heard a vicious howl, wolf&#8209;like, that
transmuted into a growl, and the next thing she saw was a hazy form hurtle past
her and splash into the water.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Actually, it was two forms, and the darker one was flailing
while the lighter one bore down on him, her teeth on his throat.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;No!&quot; she screamed &quot;Don't.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As the pair drifted past her in the current, still linked she
reached out and seized Knickers' collar, yanking her back. Then she watched
helplessly as Kenji Noda disappeared into the dark. Could he swim with one arm?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The cops were futilely searching the wide river with their
searchlight, looking for the helicopter, for anything, but there was nothing
left to see.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She quietly made for shore, even as she and Knickers were
being swept downstream by the current When they finally reached the bank, it
was somewhere around Morton Street. Oddly enough, she wasn't cold and she
wasn't tired when she drew herself up onto the rocks, Knickers at her side. She
just lay panting for a moment.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Come here, baby,&quot; she said drawing Knickers to
her. The dog was shivering and she knew she had to get her home soon.
&quot;Thank God you can't talk. I think something very evil just passed from
the world.&quot;</span></p>

color:windowtext'>Epilogue</span></b></a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>Thursday,
June 25 </span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>10:49<span
style='text-transform:uppercase'> p.m.</span></span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;You're really something,&quot; Stone declared, falling
back onto the rumpled sheets. &quot;What's come over you lately? Don't you ever
get tired?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Maybe I'm just happy to be alive,&quot; Ally said,
smiling as she ran a finger down his chest. &quot;I'm catching up on all the
living I've been missing out on.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Her heart was definitely on the mend, in several ways. She
was beginning to think she was in love. After Steve went missing, she thought
that love would never happen again, but maybe it had.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Know what,&quot; he said, rising up,
&quot;I've really worked up an appetite. How about you? Think I'll make an
omelet. Got any eggs left in the fridge?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Should be some,&quot; she said. &quot;But I'll pass.
Anything I eat after ten goes straight to places on my body that don't need
further reinforcement.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It was so nice just to have someone to be near again. Her
nervous system was still recovering from the harrowing experience down on the
pier. In fact, she wasn't really sure</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>what </span></i><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;color:windowtext'>actually had happened. The crashed
McDonnell Douglas was retrieved from the water the next day, but there were no
bodies aboard. Had Winston Bartlett drowned and his body been swept out to sea
by the tide? Also, there must have been a third person, a pilot. And what about
Kenji Noda, who also was missing? Did he make it to shore? In any case, they
all had disappeared. The case was closed. And since nobody had found a will,
New York State was currently the executor of his fortune. Eileen Bartlett was
sole heir. Her waiting game had paid off superbly. The price of her Gerex
shares was doubling every two weeks. She was about to become a very rich woman
indeed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>But had Winston Bartlett really gone to a watery grave? Ally
somehow doubted it. He had too much invested in life to cash in so easily.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As she watched Stone get up and swathe himself in a huge
white towel before heading for the kitchen, she found herself replaying that
harrowing scene at the pier. She kept trying to remember something Bartlett had
said about forming some kind of society. Was she fantasizing or had he said he
was going to do that and then offer the Beta procedure to its members? What was
he going to call it? Try as she might, she couldn't remember. She had developed
a mental block that her mind was using to shield her psyche from the horror of
that evening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>That night she'd first considered going to St. Vincent's
Hospital emergency room for the gunshot wound but then she'd thought it over
and decided there were too many things to explain that couldn't be explained
Instead she just went home and washed the wound and filled it up with
Neosporin. She didn't even tell Nina. The next morning, scar tissue was already
forming. Now it was completely healed and even the scar had all but
disappeared.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>Had the Beta really worked? She wanted to tell Stone about
that possibility, but she wasn't sure how he would take it. And she absolutely
did not want to end up in the book.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She pulled on a terry cloth robe and slippers and padded her
way into the kitchen. She wasn't hungry, but she felt like a glass of wine. She
poked around in the wine rack in the kitchen closet and came up with a bottle
of Bordeaux. Stone was cracking large white eggs into a stoneware bowl.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Sure I can't make some for you?&quot; he asked, leaning
over to buss her hair as she searched in the drawer for a corkscrew. &quot;I'm
gonna throw in some cheddar, but I'll leave it out if that doesn't work for
you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I just want a glass of red wine,&quot; she said,
retrieving the corkscrew. &quot;And I need a memory jogging. What's a word that
makes you think of living a long time? I . . .  I want to look up something on
the Internet and I don't know how to start.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What kind of word is it?&quot; he queried. &quot;I'm a
wordsmith. Twenty questions. Is it a noun, a verb, an adjective?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;If I could remember that, I might be able to come up
with it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>He was tossing a quarter stick of butter into the pan.
&quot;Hey, I once learned hypnosis. Why don't you let me take you under?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Does that really work?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;It's how I come up with interview stuff sometimes, from
years ago. We really do have a complicated memory system. I think everything
you ever knew is buried somewhere, maybe in a tiny little wrinkle.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She suspected he might be right. In this case the repressed
info was still there; it just had been deliberately covered over and hidden.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;So do you want to hypnotize me? You're sure you know
how?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm not boasting, but I could make Methuselah remember
the day he first got out of diapers.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She stared at him. &quot;My God, I think that's it.
Methuselah. I think that's the word I couldn't remember.&quot; She kissed him
on the mouth enthusiastically. &quot;I've got to check something.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She popped the cork and poured herself a glass.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Want some?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I'm not sure what goes with eggs at this time of night.
Probably tequila.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Good luck. You know where to find it. There're some
limes in the fridge. Right now I'm going to fire up the Dell and do a little
search.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Now? &quot; His face dropped. &quot;How about a little
romantic . . . whatever?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Come and join me. Bring your plate. We'll go exploring
in cyberspace. It'll be a romantic voyage. I've got a hunch about
something.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She walked back into the bedroom and clicked on the computer.
She sipped at her wine, deep but still fruity and delicious, as it booted up.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What's going on?&quot; he asked as he wandered in. He
was carrying a shot glass of tequila and a white plate with the cheese
omelette. The aroma was seductive.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I want to check out something. I have to be honest and
confess I've been holding out on you a little. When I saw Winston Bartlett that
night on the pier, something he said—&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Ally, I need to do some confessing too. The time never
seemed quite right. I need to tell you something about him.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, don't tell me now. I don't think I can handle
anything else to worry about tonight. Please save it.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She was logging on to AOL. Then she went to the search engine
Google, which she had found to be the best.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;I want to check out that name you came up with. It rang
a bell.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She typed in Methuselah, supposedly the guy who lived for
nearly a thousand years.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>There were pages and pages of references relating to that
word. It started with a five&#8209;thousand&#8209;year&#8209;old pine tree,
then an article from Modern Maturity on how to extend life, then Caltech
research on a longevity gene, then a rock band in Texas (undoubtedly very
retro), a short story by Isaac Bashevis Singer, and so it went.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;What, exactly, are you looking for?&quot; he asked,
holding out a folk. &quot;Here. Want a bite?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She reached and tore off a fluffy corner. He did eggs
perfectly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Thanks,&quot; she said, chewing. Now she was moving to
the third page. &quot;I think I'm looking for an organization. And Methuselah
was in the name. At least . . . that's what I seem to remember. I'm definitely
repressing a lot.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Well, what about that one?&quot; he asked, pointing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>&quot;Then why not give it a shot,&quot; Stone said.
&quot;You're on AOL. You'd have to be a civilian.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>She typed in her address and entered it. Immediately a little
yellow padlock appeared in the lower right&#8209;hand corner, indicating their
communication was secure. Then a notice materialized, a small square flickering
to life. It contained her phone number and then her name. Next a complete
financial record began to scroll down. It had been elicited from banks,
mortgage companies, credit services. There was Value of Real Estate owned,
Mortgages Outstanding, Bank Accounts, Outstanding Obligations, Estimated Net
Worth. It had all appeared in a time span of seconds.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>How much of the foregoing is true or even plausible?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>In late 2002, medical researchers in Dusseldorf announced
they had successfully treated heart&#8209;attack victims using stem cells
harvested from the patients' own bone marrow. The stem cells were delivered to
damaged heart muscle via angioplasty catheters, a minimally invasive procedure.
Subsequent monitoring indicated that the stem cells had reduced the damage to
heart&#8209;muscle tissue and had improved their heart function when compared
to similar patients in a control group who had declined the procedure.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>It's already happening.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>The miraculous stem cell cures in this story are essentially
an extrapolation of research well underway that has been the subject of
magazine covers and is possibly the most promising and, yes, problematic field
of medical research. The clocks at the Dorian Institute ran faster than
ordinary timepieces, and research areas and cures that currently are only
speculation were made real there. But that's why it's called fiction. As with
the example cited above, many stem cell miracles conjured here may be just over
the horizon.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
color:windowtext'>As for Kristen and the Methuselah Society, they are a
fictional embodiment of misgivings given voice by many, including no less an
authority than Professor Leonard Hayflick, whose Hayflick limit, defining the
process of how cells grow old could be said to be the underpinning of modern
stem cell research. He is now a leading bioethicist who is sufficiently
convinced of our potential to use stem cells to arrest the actual aging process
that he has worried about its ramifications in print. He makes no claim that
such a thing is imminent, but he doesn't dismiss its possibility either. He has
far&#8209;reaching societal concerns about this, and he also raises biological
issues such as, if you've treated your brain malady by using stem cells to grow
new neural tissue, have you altered your mind? Are you still you?</span></p>
